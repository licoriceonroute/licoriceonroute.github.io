As usual the ICE is well-booked, which I notice especially when it comes to the now-normalized dance between the reserved bike spots and the helpless parents with baby carriages, searching for a place to park them. There isn’t much to do but hang my bike and sympathize with them over the lack of space.

The Flat fields of the north soon give way to the hills of middle Germany. The ICE peeking out of tunnels for a brief view of small valley towns and forests, showing colourful signs of fall. Especially on the new high-speed route between Kassel and Fulda the going is quick and the overcast fall day and the dark tunnels swap places quickly, as if controlled by a child playing with a light switch.

I arrived in Mannheim, where my friend Severin picked me up from the main station. Together we biked to a nice Ramen restaurant and had a lovely dinner. Afterwards he dropped me back at the station and I got on the S2 to Kaiserslautern, the train started off fairly full and emptied less quickly than I had anticipated. 

It’s truly dark now and there isn’t much to see outside of the windows. I look forward to waking up tomorrow and seeing where I am for the first time. 

I emerge from the train at Neidenfels into a chilly night, I turn on all my lights and don some warmer clothes before biking along the river and then up into the mountains. The flat bike path quickly gives way to steep leaf-covered forestry roads, and I soon remove the warmer layers as the climb intensifies.
