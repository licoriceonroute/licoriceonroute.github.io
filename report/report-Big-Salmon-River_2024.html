</h5>
<p>
The long awaited moment is near. I write this sitting in the plane from Frankfurt to Vancouver, hardly able to keep still.
<br>
The idea of wilderness that has captured my imagination for around two years is becoming ever more real.
<br><br>
Our objective: to paddle the Big Salmon River, from the flatwater put-in on Quiet Lake, down through its confluence with the Yukon River, and taking out at Carmacks.
<br>
The river is relatively low in the fall, we expect whitewater at classes I and II, probably not any higher.
<br>
Camping every night on the banks of the river, fishing as much as we can, and maybe some hiking on the side. 
<br>
The weather looks warmer than expected, negative temperatures seem like they might pass us by. I hope it won’t be too warm at night, but that remains to be seen.
<br><br>
Last September, while on a bike trip from Erfurt to Bamberg, I wrote that I would attempt to connect with the natural side of the landscapes I rode through. As if it was something fleeting that needed real effort to capture. This September, I expect no such effort will be required. I await the feeling of isolation that has eluded me so far in Europe; to be disconnected, if only for a few weeks.
<br><br>
Now all that remains is to get there, and I can’t get there soon enough.

We woke early-ish but still managed to leave later than planned for shopping.
<br><br>
The expedition for food to the Real Canadian Superstore — my first time visiting as an, I guess up to now, not “real” Canadian — took up most of the day’s mental energy. The rest was used up packing the food and our personal gear into barrels and dry bags.</p>

  A dinner at the Ribs & Salmon, while passable, is not to be recommended. Apparently ownership had changed since the last time my fellow canoers had been there.

The day started with a final pack of our bags prior to heading out to meet the outfitter. 
The drive east on the Alaska highway to Johnsons Crossing was smooth, 
and after stopping for some cinnamon buns and scones we set off north on Canol Road. 
This road was originally built as an access road for an oil pipeline providing an un-blockadeable 
source of oil for military installations in 1943, as a part of the Canadian Oil (Canol) project

<p>
Canol Rd. was an altogether bumpier affair compared to the paved Alaska Highway, 
and over a little more than two hours the trees got ever more yellow as we neared Quiet Lake. 
The outfitter dropped us off in the upper third of the around 30km long lake. We packed our boats and climbed in, 
settling into the canoes that would carry us down the next 360km. As we put into the calm lake I wondered about 
the other beautiful places along the road had we continued our drive. The put-ins to the Nisutlin, South Macmillan, 
Pelly… but the immediate surroundings drew my focus back, we were finally underway.

<p>
Steering north towards the outlet we stopped at the Louis Fox Cabin to take out our rods, 
and set about casting around the stream out of Quiet Lake. In around twenty minutes six arctic 
grayling found their way into the canoes, a quick stop on shore to gut them and we were in our first running water. 
The shallow stream had just enough water to carry us over the gravel and moss-covered stones, small swifts punctuated 
the waterway bringing us quickly to Sandy Lake.

<p>
Despite some headwinds, the lake passed by, with the leafy trees on the slopes giving the unending green a small 
tickling of yellow. A lone loon was the only bird we sighted until we got to our campsite, a sandy spit 
reaching into the north end of the lake. As we pulled up, a bald eagle swooped across to a tree opposite the cove 
to the north as if to keep a watchful eye on the new arrivals. The rest of the campsite was uneven and treed, but 
three tent sites were found, so we set on with a fire and dinner. The brand new machete, which you will not hear 
much more about, was baptized with the mass decapitation of the grayling. The fish were grilled in the open fire, 
skin on, filled with dill, salt, and lemons; and the potatoes cooked with salt in the pan. We retired by the fire, 
some reaching for candy, others for whisky, excited to be there.

<p>
The night was fairly warm (6°C), and we awoke to an overcast  sky, with some gaps in the cover revealing the sunlit 
golden-red peaks across the lake. We decided to finish the bread we brought to make our only non-porridge breakfast, 
making french toast and taking it slow in the morning. Something I appreciated being still affected by jet lag. For the french 
toast we used half of the dozen fresh eggs, the other half we will keep for later, hoping they do not break in the barrels. 
To compliment the french toast we fried up some apples and pears in honey and cinnamon.

<p>
Today we will stay at this camp, fly fishing for practice (Jan, Niels, Jonah), or casting for lake trout (Basti and Dennis). 
Blue gaps speckled the sky, opening and closing intermittently as the day wore on. 
<br>
We three fly fishermen paddled downriver until we reached a wide, knee-deep gravel bank, with enough space for us to cast 
into the deeper water.
<br>
This was my first time fly fishing and the beginning was tough, learning not to use my wrist and not to extend my arm 
too far backwards, relying instead on the flex of the pole to send the jig back the other way. Eventually I figured out the 
rhythm and could reliably recover my line for another cast without losing extension. I got a few nibbles, but wasn’t quite 
quick enough to reel anything in. More than a few times I stopped, removing my focus from fishing, to take in the views of 
the endless trees and mountains, both only interrupted by the comparatively small winding river in which I stood.
</p>

  <figcaption>Learning the Ropes</figcaption>
<br>

<p>
A further excursion down the river didn’t reveal any better spots and, as the current made it less enticing to paddle back 
the further we went, we returned and got a few nibbles between some light drizzle, Jan even caught and released a grayling 
before we decided to call it a day. Before we set off a motorboat came by going upstream, two hunters returning to Quiet Lake. 
These would be the last people we would see for over a week.
<br>
We returned from downriver to find the two other fishermen resting by the fire, a large lake trout hanging on the tree behind. 
They had caught four trout and one pike, throwing all but one back. With the fire already going we joined them for my inaugural 
“yukon hotdog”: a fire-roasted pepperoni stick in a naan/tortilla with French’s mustard (Important!). 
Today we added some grilled zucchini as well.

<p>
The sun kept peeking in through the clouds, warming us throughout the afternoon to dinner. 
The steaks we brought had finally thawed out, so we enjoyed them with a side of caramelized onions and potatoes, 
with some lake trout as desert. The stars came out to greet us, sitting by the fire and craning our necks to see 
them past the firelight dancing on the trees, the silence only interrupted by a beaver on its way for a late night snack.

<p>
The colder (3­­°C) night gave way to a foggy morning, even the nearby opposite bank was obscured, my eyes straining to 
make out the dark outlines of trees on the shore. An eerie calm, the dewdrops clinging to spiderwebs, deadening even 
the blows of the axe splitting firewood. A welcome fire and too much porridge later, we broke camp, leaving behind the 
pretty spit, with a pause to cast about for trout.

<p>
Watching the others fish, my feet resting on the gunwales, the clouds kissing the mountains as they pass on by, 
I am happy to find the wilderness I came for all around. Christoph wonders aloud how many people may have stepped on 
the surrounding hills, and I wonder too. How many hidden nooks had never seen a human footprint, or when might the last 
one have been?
<br>
The river was short and swift, much like that on day one, here though the shallow gravel banks sloped to deeper troughs 
than previously. With the wind at our backs we continued, past yesterday’s fishing spot, and into Big Salmon Lake. The 
south-easterly wind has picked up, and we head west towards the Big Salmon River, still sheltered by a peninsula to the east. 
Our excitement at the prospect of tailwinds waned as we saw the whitecaps extending across the lake ahead and to the north. 
We decided we would head for the first spit of land on the south side to scout around the corner.

<p>
As we rode the growing swells towards the beach, a golden eagle swooped across to our boats and hung in the air just 
four or five metres above us, seemingly frozen in place on the wind. We could but stare upwards in wonder. The beach 
landing was messy, as the waves threatened to slop over the sides of the canoes, so we hopped out and lined the boats 
around to the leeward side.
</p>

<br>

<p>
We find ourselves on a peninsula on the southern shore of Big Salmon Lake, unable to continue due to the wind. 
From our new view north all we can see is a wild lake, too rough to brave with our fully-loaded crafts. We’re windbound; 
now the waiting begins. Sitting on the beach looking towards our goal, I feel not boredom, but disquiet. A desire to 
push onwards that I can feel in my fellow paddlers as well.
</p>

<br>

<p>
During our wait, one mountain keeps drawing my eye, clouds always obscuring its ridge and aspen flowing like pale gold 
down its shoulders, breaking the green stranglehold of the conifers. Unlike the multitude of nameless peaks, 
this is one I think I won’t forget so quickly. We cast from the shore a little, mostly just hauling in hunks of seaweed, 
and go for a swim, if a quick dive into the shallows can be called that.

<p>
The wind doesn’t abate. We make camp on the leeward shore and Christoph leads the way in making a fire. 
On that sandy beach we enjoy a delicious lentil curry and line up our chairs to gaze across the water. 
The view to the north is expansive, the biggest sky we've seen yet. Hopefully the cloud cover will lift, 
for if there were a perfect place for northern lights, this would be it. At around nine pm the sky to the 
northwest lights up in orange as the sun sets behind the mountains, the water glowing like a field of wheat 
in the summer sun.

<p>
I write this on the morning of day five, after what can only be described as a very long day. Rewind to the morning of day four. 
At our beach camp on Big Salmon Lake we woke to find no change in the weather, the wind continued. Undeterred we took down camp, 
and as we ate a quick pre-boiled egg and had some coffee our optimism was vindicated. The wind and waves lessened.
<br>
A paddle out through the smooth water off the leeward side of the spit brought us to the higher waves, which we rode to the 
north end of the lake. As I paddled, I spent more time looking back over my shoulder at the waves than at our destination, 
reading the swells. Finally we arrived at the outlet to the Big Salmon River. 
<br><br>
It started off meagre, with narrow, shallow passages 
leaving us feeling hemmed in after the wide expanses of the lakes. The river continued over gravel riffles, making small swifts. 
The biggest obstacles for these passages were the shallow gravel beds, sometimes scraping the bottom of our canoes. We arrived 
at our first class I rapid, and after a quick scout we lined the boats over a submerged log to start the first run, the wider 
left side was blocked forcing us to drag the canoes through a small side stream and run the first right hander, eddying out 
before the stream could put us into the fallen logs.
</p>

<br>

<p>
The eagles were out in force on this section, with a bald eagle one surprising Niels and Jan, taking flight just in front of 
their canoe. We saw two more golden eagles in quick succession perched on the bank and atop a tree, keeping a hungry eye on 
the bright red salmon we glided above.
<br>
The next obstacle would be an extensive log pile which blocked the river completely. We could slide the unloaded canoes through 
the gaps, saving us the effort of carrying everything around the rough bank.
<br>
Log piles and log jams block many sections of the upper Big Salmon River. Some we could line around, or slide through as above, 
but where the current is too strong, or the jams too thick, we would have to portage. Today there would be four portages, 
apparently this is more than usual for the first 25km of river. Still, we would have to pack and unpack the canoes a total of 
six times today, every one getting faster and more practiced than the last. We always ended up taking out on the right side and 
for the most challenging portage we had to take out onto a bank nearly a metre higher than the water. 
They were all of them short, just 400m combined, but still, having a canoe on my 
shoulders again for the first time in two years was a really nice feeling. One interesting feature of a few of the portages was 
the dried up riverbeds, once the river broke through a bend the loop would dry up, leaving a lower, sandier portion of land. 
These are probably very easy to see from the air as well, as the plants are much more likely to have leaves.

As the afternoon wore on, the portages were left behind for the many winding turns that would, slowly but steadily, 
bring us to our camp at Sheep Creek. The logs became much less, only a few deadheads still lay in our way. 
In all directions the mountains now surround us, some sending shadows across the river. Moose tracks line the 
right bank, earlier we saw some bear and beaver prints as well, but apart from one beaver who tail-slapped just 
before our canoe and a few squirrels chittering at us from the trees, mammals would remain elusive.

<br>

<p>
Cut banks reveal themselves on some outer curves, gliding slowly into view. Seeing the holes in the soft sand I 
wonder what kind of birds live there, I won’t find out today, they stay hidden if they were ever there at all. 
Finally we arrive at camp a few metres past the inflow of Sheep Creek.

<p>
An overgrown gravel bank greeted us, with an open area for the tents, firepit, and tarp. An enthusiastic welcome 
committee laid in wait as well, the blackflies and midges out in force, making the arrival somewhat less enjoyable. 
The first thing I did was hand out the headnets I had brought along, but luckily the flies would disappear by evening 
and never truly swarm us. We set up camp quickly, and Basti and Dennis went to catch some grayling for pasta calabrese. 
The grilled fish went straight from the fire to our noodles. After a while by the fire, full from dinner, we retired. 
Exhausted to a man.

Today is a rest day. We sleep in (at the behest of birthday boy Dennis), and have a very slow morning with porridge. 
The sun comes out for a while and disappears again. Before fishing some of us take a dip in the river, the water is 
frigid, but afterwards with a little sun it becomes wonderfully warm.

<p>
Dennis, Jan, Niels, and I go fishing by Sheep Creek, where the clear outflow pours into the Big Salmon forming a 
deeper section of calm water where grayling glide over the gravel bottom, offering themselves up for the catch. 
The best way to catch them is with a bronze 2 or 3 MEPPS, you could watch them follow the spinning hook four at a 
time before darting forward for the bite. Jan broke one of his fly fishing rods early on in the day, so I switched 
with him and got to fishing by reel. Dennis and I catch some with the reel, and Jan and Niels add some more with the 
fly. A larger, white fly was the most effective.

The sun lowered, casting golden rays across the river, the yellow banks, and the mountains behind. 
The fish we fried in a batter of eggs, flour, and oats; enjoyed along with a few beers it was a true birthday feast.

Some rain in the early hours foreshadowed the weather for the day, however it didn’t dampen our spirits as we 
departed from Sheep Creek. The journey began with a long series of swifts and rapids that were a welcome change 
to the slow, winding passages of the afternoon of day four. Around us the mountains crane out of the mists, one 
with pale cliffs shining down and a rainbow arcing over the river in a rare moment of sun. They are closer 
today, seemingly higher with more peak above the treeline. The red fireweed on the tops shining like a burning brazier. 
One shower is cold, freezing my hands, but the rest, spaced intermittently throughout the day, aren’t chilly at all.

Two moose appear on the bank. A cow and a calf, munching contentedly on some young trees, seemingly unbothered 
by us passing by a few metres away. Later on another cow swims across the river directly in front of Niels and Jan. 
As we paddle, my mood improves, until every corner, every new mountain, has me grinning, and the best is yet to come.

<p>
A passage of a series of swifts and sets of rapids punctuated by larger rocks brings the best paddling yet, 
and weaving between them is a joy. Between rapids we have to paddle across the river from side to side to avoid 
shallower spots. The fun staves off the exhaustion of the long day, the furthest we’ve paddled so far (thankfully sans portages). 
However, we’re still grateful when the last few bends arrive. One obstacle remains 
shortly before camp: a blocked river from a log jam, the right side of a small islet completely impassable, 
and the left side leaving a gap of just a few metres, maybe three, to thread the canoes between the logs and a 
large rock. We ran it with a quick left-right-left in a short burst of power. 
That release of tension got us through to camp.
</p>

<br>

<p>
The camp at Souch Creek is up on the bank, the firepit and the tarp take up the central clearing, 
with the tents off behind between the trees. We cut some wood, catch some fish, and settle down at the 
fire for baked beans, fish, and caramelized carrots, until drizzle chases us under the tarp.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Now the rushing creek and the rain on the tarp combine to create a calming atmosphere. 
The river next to camp flows quickly, and downstream I see the mountains we will pass by in the days to come. 
They become obscured by the gathering clouds, and I feel apprehensive that we may not see the northern lights on 
this trip, almost every night has been cloudy.

We’ve arrived at camp after a fairly short day on the river. Reading the map before we left, Niels estimated the 
distance to be about 50% less than it was. All day the clouds wreathed the peaks of the mountains, and the sky 
would only ever hint at blue before closing up again.

<p>
We continued for a while, following along on the map, puzzling at some of the straight sections on paper that 
only seemed to contain curves in practice. The last five kilometres were a slog, unsure when we would arrive at camp. 
Eventually we made it, and immediately set up out tents to air out, wet from the former night’s rain.

Christoph started on a fire pit, Basti and Dennis went to catch some fish, Niels doctored his tent, and Jan and 
I went to get some wood. Some of us went swimming in the river after chores. The water seemed icy cold, even just 
wetting my hair gave me a brain-freeze. But the spot was perfect, a small eddy with a sandy bottom, the sun sneaking 
in through the trees. Jan proved that a sand-angel was less conducive to childlike fun than a snow-angel. Drying off 
in the wind was chilly, but putting on clean clothes and sitting barefoot by the fire, in the sun, was absolutely 
wonderful.

A small meal of fresh fire-roasted grayling mixed with olive oil, fresh pepper, raw onion and salt on a warm naan. 
We settled in by the fire enjoying the sound of the river rushing by, half-obscured by the bushes. Later we began 
cooking. A roux with penne and mushrooms. As the noodles are cooking the mountains are suddenly lit by the setting 
sun, up and down the river the valley glows.

<p>
The cold, clear, starry night gives way to a cold, foggy morning. The mist rises off the water as people take their 
time waking up. We aren’t moving camp today, so we can afford to take it slow for breakfast. As we eat the mist 
burns off, and a clear blue sky reveals itself. 
<br><br>
Four of us are going on a hike today, Jan and Basti remaining in camp. They spend the morning and early afternoon 
making wood, then washing and sitting in the sun naked with an espresso and a cigarette. For Basti, and later Dennis, 
it truly is as close to a bath as possible. They each warm up their water over the fire for a nice hot wash, making 
it the highlight of their respective days. The rest of us head out on our hike. Above the camp there are a few 
mountains with bare spots, we will try to reach one of them to get a view of the river valley below.
<br><br>
We first cross the dried up riverbed (not actually very dry though) and cross over two eskers, circling the lake 
as we go. The forest composition changes from a mixed forest to exclusively spruce as we walk down the north face 
of the esker. Here the ground is covered with a thick moss and mushrooms litter the forest floor. On the way back 
we see a hare skip ahead of us. 
<br><br>
Despite the blue, sunny sky, this is the kind of forest that seems to be in a 
constant state of foggy despair, like in a fairytale. To the contrary, the southern slopes are covered in 
golden-leafed and silver-trunked aspen, emulating the sun even when a cloud passes above. The underbrush here is 
red and hides some brambles, which tug on our pants as we pass.
</p>

	alt="Happy Hikers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>
	<figcaption>Happy Hikers</figcaption>
<br>

<p>
We arrive at the foot of the mountain, looking over the lake below us before hiking higher. 
We keep on through the aspen-covered slopes until we reach a bare section of looser ground. 
It slides under our boots, the only security offered by the tufts of grass and prickly plants whose spines 
stick into our hands; those who brought gloves, wear them. Sometimes we traverse to a wooded area if the bare 
sections become too steep. Finally we leave the trees again to scramble up a barren crest, above the treetops, 
the valley spread out beneath us.

	<figcaption>The Climb</figcaption>
<br>

<p>
To the south, across the lake, we see a thin plume of smoke from our camp. Ducks or other waterfowl, 
themselves unseen but for the shimmering Vs of their wakes, crisscross the still lakes. Around us in every 
direction mountains rise, multicoloured foliage, bare ridges, cliffs, and high peaks give shape to the valley. 
And then the valley. Stretching from east to west in front of us, the river curls through. Bends shining where 
the light hits just right, a flowing gemstone, the sparkles of rapids and eddies visible even from up here. 
Nobody else is around, as far as we can see and further. The perspective shift, looking down at the river from the 
mountains we’ve looked up at for a week, has a profound calming effect. The exhilaration of the climb, replaced 
by reflection, wonder, and tranquility. 
<br>
It is truly one of the most profoundly beautiful things I have ever experienced.

<br>

<p>
The warm descent preps us for a dip in the river (or a hot bath for Dennis) and we can sit in the sun in only shorts, 
enjoying an afternoon snack and a beer. As we sit by the fire we see a large group of Sandhill Cranes migrating south, 
their calls breaking the stillness. A motivated group of Niels, Jan, Basti, and Dennis head out to get three fish to 
add to the meal while the rest cook. We had chili with grayling, sitting out by the fire until the incoming rain sent 
us to bed.

We got up early to get a quick start this morning. Overnight it got down to 1°C, but sadly couldn’t quite get 
below freezing. At breakfast we were surprised by a moose cow and her calf, trotting through the low water just 
past our camp.
<br>
The river was still foggy when we set off, but despite the chill we warmed up quickly. The paddling was fairly 
consistent, slower bends connected by broad gravel ripples in the straights. The mountains got smaller and more 
distant as the day wore on. The slopes are very green here, only sparse sections of yellow aspen and birch are to 
be seen, and the red fireweed on the peaks is missing completely.

The wildlife on the river today is mostly eagles, perched unmoving as gargoyles on the trees overlooking the river. 
We also see a beaver bringing a branch to the lodge. The river stayed fairly fast, helping us make good time, and 
we reached camp at 14:30.

<p>
Our campsite is described in the river book as “Big Excellent HW Camp” and we all agree it has earned that moniker. 
A fairly high bank allows me to sit above the river as I write, a rare vantage point to watch Basti and Dennis fish 
for grayling (two each so far). The whole day has been overwhelmingly overcast with one short moment  of sun, but 
it remains warm and pleasant. Tonight we’re having pasta bolognese (with corned beef), exciting after nine days. 
As we cooked we re-sorted the barrels and were accompanied throughout by the hooting of an owl ringing through the forest.

The starry and clear night proved to be the coldest yet, clocking in at zero, with some parts of the camp 
covered in a light frost. It remained clear, and as we set off with the low sun casting long shadows on the 
river. Like so often, the coldest night turned into the warmest day, eventually a few of us were only paddling 
in one upper layer. Jan and Christoph even got down to a t-shirt.
<br>
Clouds shied away, and so too did the mountains, reducing completely to low hills. What we did have more of were 
cut banks, high sandy slopes ending in the water, and hoodoos, towers of sand protruding from the tallest cut banks. 
These features helped break up the monotony of the long, seemingly never-ending curves.

<p>
We also met the two main tributaries of the Big Salmon River. Named in what must have been an incredible stroke of 
imagination, they are the South Big Salmon and North Big Salmon Rivers. I’ll let the reader figure out what side of 
the river they’re each on.
<br>
The last two days we’ve seen many more waterfowl than before, lots of ducks on the river and some geese on the 
banks (maybe they prefer the slower water?). Eagles left us alone today, but we also saw many Kingfishers.

<br>

<p>
The excruciating switchbacks were left behind for the longest stretches of straights we had paddled since the lakes. 
They began lazily, but became rougher, eventually ending in rapids shortly before our camp. Large rocks combine with 
larger but predictable waves to form fast but safe(ish) rapids, officially maybe class II, but much easier and less 
deadly than the log piles and snags upriver. The biggest challenge in these sections are the large flat-topped rocks 
over which the water flows cleanly; they are only visible through their eddies, otherwise neatly obscured from upriver 
in the flat light.
<br>
We make camp at the inflow of the North Big Salmon River, hoodoos towering above. As we relax on the bank the rushing of the 
river is briefly overpowered by the sound of a jet boat. Two hunters coming up the river give us a quick greeting and 
speed into the, to us, unknown regions of the North Big Salmon. We enjoy some beers and whiskey together in the 
sun, and pasta with pesto for dinner.

The clear night turned into another cold morning with the temperature finally dropping to negative one. 
Before breakfast I went up to the top of the hoodoos above camp to see the view. Before me stretched the 
shallow valley, mountains in the distance dark and backlit by the sun. The forest of green and yellow filling 
the wide expanse between. Weaving through it all was the Big Salmon River, glinting in the morning sun and our 
camp tucked away in the trees. To the right, just downriver, I could already make out the first set of rapids 
for the day.
</p>

We got the camp packed into the canoes just as it started to rain.
<i>
  —side note, I just traded a Babybel 1:1 for an Oh!Henry. Apparently cheese is the new hottest commodity the evening of day eleven— 
</i>
 The rain would accompany us all the way to our camp this afternoon.

<p>
The rapids started out with the best class II set we would see all trip, a few huge boulders, some snags, 
and standing waves gave us some great early-morning fun. The Big Salmon River mostly continued like this, 
nice class Is and IIs with fast flowing water in between. The rain, for me, only enhanced the whitewater experience. 
<br>
Larger and larger the cut banks became, taking up more and more of every corner. Soon a novel river formation 
came into view, a braid. The river builds up sediments and sandbars to form new channels and merge old ones. 
We thought we would have choose carefully which channel to take, lest it be too shallow or narrow. Luckily the choices were 
simple, the highest flow was always the correct option, and we passed through easily.
</p>

<p>
The last big tight corner had a huge eddy off the nose, almost forcing all our canoes into a spin. 
At the camp just behind, a canoe was pulled up and two figures waved out from next to a campfire. 
It seemed like they might be taking a rest day to wait out the rain. Just before the last bend we see a basecamp. 
A hot tent with the stove lit, a boat pulled up (same model as the hunters yesterday).
<br>
The end of the Big Salmon River: here it combines with the Yukon River, and what just hours ago seemed 
strong and wide is immediately dwarfed by the power of the Yukon. This new waterway flows fast and the upwellings are strong enough 
to push the canoe sideways in a way I have never experienced. The cut banks are larger as well, looming high above 
us, the river chewing on the mountains in geological time.

<p>
We visit Big Salmon Village and watch two more boats jet up the Big Salmon River. 
Now as we paddle a faint rustling can be heard from the boats, like someone shaking dried flowers. 
The sediments and stones scraping along the bottom of the river and reverberating in the hull.

<p>
Morale was waning as we got near to the camp, it was the only time on this trip I would feel drained of energy. 
Based on their body language, the others weren’t faring any better. We arrive at our camp, after a very exhausting 
day of paddling in the rain. It’s near an old gold dredge (Cyr’s Dredge). There the rain finally stops.

We set up camp and put the chairs out in the sun to dry off, before having a yukon hotdog and a beer, 
looking over the quick flow of the river. Basti and Dennis are fishing now, and are so successful 
(probably the golden MEPPS) that we’ll be having grayling and potatoes with scrambled eggs 
(the last of the dozen fresh ones we started with). Now the sun is coming out, I think I’ll take a nice little nap.

Today we have a full day on the Yukon. A warm night brings a warm, bright morning, and we paddle into a slightly 
overcast river. The first two kilometres we paddle separated, but afterwards we tie the canoes together like a 
trimaran. When the wind comes from behind we can pull up a groundsheet on the paddles for a bit more speed. 
As we float by the riverbanks a lynx appears but for a moment before slinking silently back into the undergrowth. 
Basti pulls out his rod, today trying with a wobbler. We’re making excellent time, but without paddling the wind 
feels a little colder. We cook our yukon hotdogs in the canoes, adding some baked beans.

We pass a mountain where the sands are washed away in a regular pattern, letting aspen and spruce grow in tiger 
stripes of yellow and green. We reach the confluence with the Little Salmon River and shortly thereafter we see 
the graveyard of Little Salmon Village, where little houses are built on each grave.
<br>
Not long after the graveyard we get to our campsite. A forested site with differing elevations. From here we can 
hear the Campbell Highway between Carmacks and Faro. Our first step in the build-up of re-socialization to Carmacks, 
and then Whitehorse.
<br>
A light rain comes while setting up the tents, and sets the mood for a cozy lentil stew by the fire.

Similar to the day before we would spend the day in the Yukon, today however started with some drizzle after 
breakfast so we paddled the first eight kilometres before lashing together our raft.

<p>
The low clouds obscured the surroundings, and all we could really make out was the swift river and the colourful 
foliage on the banks. The sun came out for but a moment before being again obscured by dark clouds. Sandhill Cranes 
fly by again like at the esker site, and we watch the cyclic breaking apart and re-combining of their formations 
until they disappear from view. So we spend the day, eating, snoozing, sometimes paddling but mostly just enjoying 
the rest.

We disconnect the canoes and paddle the last few hundred metres before arriving at the coalmine campground 
outside Carmacks. We unload the boats and organize our accommodations. Niels and I will take our tents while 
the others will sleep in a cabin together.

<p>
A three kilometre walk into town brought us to the Gold Panner Restaurant, a  dive next to the gas 
station/supermarket where we got some burgers that were as crispy as the fries. After thirteen days 
of cooking for ourselves it was nice to eat at a table and not have to wash the dishes or dodge the 
campfire’s smoke. Afterwards we hit the supermarket for everything that we had been missing. Candy bars, 
fresh fruit, a blueberry pie, milk, cola, and so on… We indulged back at the campground.

Near midnight Christoph spotted a greenish tint on the horizon, and as we stepped down to the dock the northern 
lights spread out across the sky, curtains of green reflected off the river. Pale ribbons saluting the end of our 
trip like astral ticker tape.

<p>
We were picked up by the outfitter — a Swabian by the last name of Wolf, who had paddled the Big Salmon River 41 
times, mostly as a guide — and driven to Whitehorse where we picked up a truck and repacked our bags.

<p>
After driving Dennis, Christoph, and Basti to their hotel from which they would depart to the airport the next morning, 
Jan, Niels, and I turned west for our drive out to Haines Junction. The sun was low and it was partly cloudy, sending 
long dramatic shadows across the landscape. 
<br>
On the drive from Carmacks to Whitehorse we followed a small river and on both sides the forests stretched out onto the 
surrounding hills. If before the trip there had been a sprinkling of yellow throughout the forests, now swathes of bright 
yellow colour the landscape, in stark contrast to the pine, otherwise black from the rain.
<br>
From Whitehorse to Haines Junction the yellow remains, but the landscape changes to a wide open valley between bare mountains. 
Every now and then we stop to properly admire the view, the windswept valley and low sun create an almost mystical air for me, 
the top of every rise spreading out a new sight to languish in.

<p>
Eventually, as dark outlines against the setting sun, we see the mountains of the Auriol range in Kluane National Park, 
and nestled below, the town of Haines Junction, population 1018.
<br>
We have dinner at the Mile 1016 Pub and head south towards Kathleen Lake, alongside the peaks that rise up just to the right. 
Reaching the campground, it is already dark, so we set up the tents and the tarp quickly and retire, eager to see the 
indistinctly outlined mountains in the splendour of the full sun. The Northern Lights are out tonight, 
with a tint of purple as well.

We started the day at the Kathleen Lake Campground, and headed into town for breakfast at Cozy Corner; where, after an 
omelette and coffee/hot chocolate, our clothes no longer smelled as if we had sat at a campfire for two weeks, but had 
rather spent the last six months in a deep fryer. 
<br>
A visit to the very expansive visitors’ and cultural centre solidified our understanding of the surrounding area, especially 
helpful was a scale model of Kluane National Park, which showed us the expanse of the ice fields we were stood at the edge of. 
There is so much more beauty just behind the already gorgeous Auriol Range. Maybe I’ll be able to catch a glimpse. 
<br><br>
We hike the Auriol Loop, which takes us to the toes of the Auriol Mountains and Mount Martha Black. The treeline here is at 
around 1000m, and we have a clear view of the barren slopes stretching up above us. I get the sense that the shrubbery here 
is barely hanging on to the rocky soil, a low carpeting of yellow and orange before the bare black scree begins just above. 
There is a backcountry campsite you can hike into here, apparently it is popular with mountain climbers wishing to tackle 
Mt. Martha Black. We don’t see any, and I don’t blame them, as there is fresh snow topping the highest peaks.

Afterwards it’s back to Kathleen Lake Campground for a swim. We couldn’t quite manage to psych ourselves up enough, 
so we sat on the tailgate looking into the vicious wind that swept towards us across the lake and threatened to tear 
the ketchup chips from our grasp. (Ketchup chips were required to broaden my international companions' cultural horizons).

<br>

<p>
A group from the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations arrived by the waters’ edge and one of them jumped in to cheers from 
his friends. Having proved it was possible he told us to go for it, so we did. 
<br>
The water was very cold, certainly colder than the Rivers, and the wind didn’t help things, but it was invigorating. 
<br><br>
An older member of the First Nations group spoke to us about the lake and its significance. He said it was more than 100m deep, 
and the only place where Kokanee Salmon live. Kokanee are a smaller relative of the Chinook Salmon, but unlike the Chinook 
they do not migrate or even leave Kathleen Lake. The reason for their sedentary lifestyle was a Glacier which blocked access 
to the sea for hundreds of years, in this time they adapted to stay in freshwater their whole lives. 
The blocked river created a huge lake which geologists think probably emptied in as fast as one day. 
First Nations on the coast have stories of a huge, sudden flood which claimed many lives. 
<br><br>
He also explained that the young man who jumped in and some of the others were members of the S'ólh Téméxw Stewardship 
Alliance
<a href="https://thestsa.ca/about-stsa/"><sup>[2]</sup></a> 
(“Guardians”)
<a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023WLRS0009-000444"><sup>[3]</sup></a> 
from Chilliwack, British-Columbia, who were visiting the Champagne and Aishihik First 
Nations for a cultural exchange. He told us how they were employed by First Nations to serve as their “eyes and ears” 
or “boots on the ground” in their territories, and are experts who help monitor and manage protected areas, restore animal 
and plant habitats, offer Indigenous knowledge, and respond to environmental emergencies.
<br><br>
The two groups are holding a cultural exchange to show each other their lands and speak about the unique challenges facing 
them in the way they manage environmental and interpersonal impacts of recreation and industry in their respective areas. 
The Champagne and Aishihik were in Chilliwack the week before, and now the S’óhl Téméxw were visiting here. 
<br><br>
We were generously invited to eat with them and over dessert (fruit cup) I talked to one Guardian who told me about their 
job in B.C. building stewardship liaisons between Seventeen First Nations in the Fraser valley area. They share their history, 
cultural events, opportunities for grant money and environmental protection. All of this happens on a level which is removed 
from the tribal councils and government structures. It’s a grassroots organization that allows these activities on a more 
personal and inclusive level. It was interesting to see them trade their local knowledge and show each other around their 
culturally important sites. 
<br>
The woman from Chilliwack was very taken with the rock glaciers and the golden foliage, apparently 
the Fraser valley has very few deciduous trees. She was also very interested in the self-governance with which the 
Champagne and Aishihik First Nations function, as the First Nations in Southern B.C. don’t have as much leeway or influence 
regarding decisions concerning their ancestral lands. It was explained to me that the treaties in the Yukon were much clearer 
whereas in B.C. there is a lot of difference of opinion and unceded territory.

<p>
We left our hosts and drove south to the rock glacier
<a href="https://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glacier-processes/glacier-types/rock-glaciers/"><sup>[4]</sup></a> 
that the older man had suggested we see. 
The short jaunt over the waves of stone also included incredible views of Lake Dezadeash in the evening sun. 
After another dinner at the Mile 1016 we retired back at the campsite with a fire under the full moon. 
<br><br>
The night was cloudless, and despite the full moon, when it got darker the northern lights began again. 
Tonight was the first night where they truly spread out above and all around us; stopping and becoming weaker, 
before starting up again in a different part of the sky and spreading from there anew.

The night was cold for the first time. -4°C. I finally slept with my sleeping bag zipped up, nice to use it as intended at 
least once this trip. We cooked porridge on the campfire before getting ready to set off on our hike of King’s Throne Peak. 
All morning we could see it through the clear air as we cooked and readied ourselves. 
<br><br>
The hike starts through a forest, with the mountain in view the whole time. In the woods we spotted a porcupine lumbering 
through the undergrowth. It moves the way I imagine a sea slug with legs would move, almost oozing across the shrubs in a 
very endearing way. The verticality started in the forest but soon we reached the treeline. 
The path took us up a rock glacier like the one we had seen the day before, winding up loose gravel and scree, 
setting the time for the rest of the hike. All the while we would turn around and admire the ever expanding view. 
</p>

	<figcaption>The Quill is Mightier than the Sword</figcaption>
<br>

<p>
The top of the rock glacier is a cirque backed by a high ridge on three sides. This is called the King’s Throne. 
The peak trail is not the normal hike, but parks Canada has included it on some maps as an official trail. 
To reach the peak trail we turned left at the throne and began to climb up the southern ridge. The path got steeper and the 
switchbacks more frequent, weaving around the ridgeline. Our feet slid on the loose stones every step, some sections were 
rocky enough to step from outcropping to outcropping, but they would only last for a few metres before turning back to gravel. 
</p>

<p>
The ridge became less steep at around 1800m and we caught our first glimpse of the landscape beyond the first row of peaks. 
Dark scree-covered peaks and lower reaches covered in yellow trees leading down to the azure waters of the lakes between. 
Hiking north along the ridge towards the peak we could see further afield to the impressive Hubbard-Alverston-Kennedy Massif, 
and the vast snowfields of Kluane National Park.

<p>
At the peak, Lake Kathleen laid out below, and the mountains in the direction of Whitehorse, which had seemed so 
impressive on the drive over, were shrunken at our feet when compared to those to the west. The exposure up here 
was intense, and the wind would come in huge gusts, whipping around anything loose. Despite the wind and sun it 
was a beautifully clear day, and the view is one I will not have trouble remembering.

Our final porridge. We cleared out the rest of the add-ons as well as possible. Heating the Nutella up at the fire for the last time. A light drizzle interrupted our tear-down, and we had to pack the tents and tarp up a little wet.

<br>

<p>
The mountaintops were obscured by cloud, and on the slopes a fresh dusting of snow was clearly visible. We turned north, then 
east, driving the same route in reverse that we had taken on the 15th. This time, with the overcast skies, the views were a 
little less dramatic, but the sun shone through every now and then giving us one last golden goodbye from the vast forests.
<br><br>
We stopped by the Whitehorse Food Bank to drop off our unopened foodstuffs and returned the truck. Tonight we would stay at 
the Beez Kneez Bakpakers, a hostel geared towards out-of-towners that Jan had been to before. The small cabin in the yard we 
decided on was just big enough to air out our tent flys as we headed towards dinner down the waterfront trail. 
<br>
The waterfront trail in Whitehorse is part of the Trans Canada Trail, it felt curious to walk the same trail I had walked 
parts of in Ontario here, so far away, but I guess that’s the point after all. In two days I would also inadvertently end 
up on the Burnaby portion, a happy coincidence. 
<br><br>
An old paddle steamer is laid up on the riverbank as a historic site. This huge boat only has a draft of 1m, and plied its 
trade up and down the Yukon river. The trip from Whitehorse to Dawson took 1.5 days with 3 wood stops for 40 cords of wood 
total, the upriver trip from Dawson to Whitehorse took 5-7 days and 6-8 wood stops for about 160 cords of wood. I can’t begin 
to imagine living in a woodyard on the banks of the Yukon spending all day producing those huge quantities of chopped wood 
just so the steamers could stop by and load it all to burn.
<br><br>
We had a nice evening reminiscing about the past few weeks at the Dirty Northern to celebrate Jan’s birthday and got ourselves 
ready for a short night before we had to leave for the airport.

<br>

<p>
I’m sitting in the waiting area of Erik Nielsen Airport in Whitehorse with a few hours until my flight, contemplating the 
grandeur of the place I am preparing to leave.
<br>
In the last few weeks I have certainly had an experience I will not forget and—at least in this moment—am excited to expand 
upon in the future.
<br>
There were some difficult moments, but the trip was truly incredible. I had prepared myself not to see the northern lights, 
but they came just in time anyhow.
<br><br>
The hiking in Kluane after the trip was amazing, and it was really nice to get a feel for the vast openness of that part of 
the Yukon after being on a river for so long. I think next time I would do the hiking first, to truly be able to appreciate 
where I am and ground myself there before starting a more strenuous and focused trip on the river. The jet lag didn’t do much 
to help, either.
<br>
Although it was certainly the highlight, I’m very happy that I didn’t just come for the Big Salmon River; it shows me that I 
should keep pushing beyond what first draws me to somewhere, in order to find other things that are truly special about the 
places I visit.
<br><br>
And this is a place I will visit again. Both the prospect of another canoe trip on a more technical and remote river, as well 
as a multi-day backcountry hiking trip will surely pull me back. When, I don’t know, but I look forward to it all the same.

  <span class='dd'>Notes for the Future</span>
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
For lazy river curves and lakes I would really have appreciated a longer, flatter blade. Preferably an otter- or 
beaver-tail design. Especially the shaft continuing into the blade felt like it sucked away my energy on every J-stroke, 
wood is better than plastic for the smooth blade in that regard.
</li>
<li>
A PFD designed for paddling would have been preferable to the straight-cut ones we were provided with.
</li>
<li>
A canoe patch kit would have been nice for peace of mind.
</li>
<li>
A map holder with clips is a must for the next trip.
</li>
<li>
Lighter and smaller chairs (Chair One etc…) would be preferable for packing the canoes and weight while paddling and portaging.
</li>
<li>
My -9°C comfort bag with thin long underwear was too warm over 6°C and could be used as a blanket to -1°C. Only zipped 
up once for the -4°C night. My sleeping pad was amazing in all conditions we faced.
</li>
<li>
I enjoyed having two outer drybags. The zippered one was really good for looking through without digging around too much. 
If there’s another river trip with less portaging a bigger duffel might even be good. Otherwise the larger they get the 
more difficult and uncomfortable they are to carry. 
</li>
<li>
A bespoke light for the tent is quite nice, especially if forced inside early if it’s dark. Ultimately not necessary though. 
</li>
<li>
Everyone should bring a whistle on a breakable cord. The outfitter didn’t provide them. 
</li>
<li>
A pump could be a better way of getting water out of the bottom of a boat, especially from between bags or a spray-skirt. 
any colder water or rougher rapids and a paddle suit would be the safe option. 
</li>
<li>
The marmot tungsten 3p remains ideal for two people and stays solidly anchored in all conditions. 
</li>
<li>
The extra drybags were good to have, extra drawstring non-waterproof bags could also be ok. 
</li>
<li>
We ultimately could have used more ziplocks.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some wishes that were vocalized on the trip:
Mayonnaise, cream, harissa paste, more beer, better whisky, more nuts, some tupperware, more clips/carabiners, salt&vinegar 
chips, at least one snickers per day, bigger or two seat pads (Half a z-lite?).
