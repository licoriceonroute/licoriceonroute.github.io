<h1>Pfalz-Vosges</h1>
<h2>Oct. 30th - Nov. 3rd 2024</h2>

<p>
  <span class='dd'>Preface</span>
</p>
<p>
  I’m waiting at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof for the ICE to Mannheim, thinking about my goals for this trip. Last September I biked from Erfurt to Bamberg through the Thüringian Forest and Franconian Switzerland, 
  experiencing the managed forests and pastoral landscapes, along with some interesting sights.
<br><br>
  This time I’m headed to the Palatinate Forest (Naturpark Pfälzerwald) and the northern Vosges Mountains (Parc naturel régional des Vosges du Nord), 
  a continuous area of forested medium mountains straddling the border between Germany and France. (According to the tourism boards of both regions—together it is the largest contiguous forest in Europe).
  </p>
    <br>

    <br>
  <p>
  I’ll start near the north of the forest and snake my way down south. On my way I hope to experience the nature of the forest along with the many castles, towers, and ruins scattered throughout the mountains. 
  Mostly I am drawn to the terrain—I know it will not disappoint—but I know from last year’s experience to take my time to enjoy the cultural sites as well. 
<br><br>
  I will camp the first three nights, the first two at trekking sites, the next at a hut in the Vosges. The last night I will stay with friends in Haguenau, France.
<br><br>
  I expect the cycling to be fairly difficult for me, once again leaving the flatland of northern Germany for a mountainous region. Every day will include a fair amount of elevation, 
  but I tried to balance Kilometers traveled and the surface I ride on: the rougher the terrain the shorter the distance. 
<br><br>
  I have a lot of food with me at the beginning as I won’t be able to buy anything Thursday or Friday. Thursday I will be away from any shopping possibilities, 
  and Friday is a public holiday in both Rheinland-Pfalz and Alsace. My main means of replenishment will be the one open bakery in Hauenstein the morning of day three. 
<br><br>
  I hope that the weather will be as good as forecast and that I will be able to beat the sunset every day except day one.
<br><br>
  My main goal is to get more comfortable with multi day travel and also with planning more diverse routes, as well as improving my knowledge of how my body reacts to lots of climbing and longer distances after a few days. 
  I don’t know if I’ll be able to check off everything, but I think I’ll gain some insights that I’ll be able to implement for future trips, especially when planning for regions I haven’t been to.

<p>
  As usual the ICE is well-booked, which I notice especially when it comes to the now-normalized dance between the reserved bike spots and the helpless parents with baby carriages, 
  searching for a place to park them. There isn’t much to do but hang my bike and sympathize with them over the lack of space.
<br><br>
  The Flat fields of the north soon give way to the hills of middle Germany. The ICE peeking out of tunnels for a brief view of small valley towns and forests, showing colourful signs of fall. 
  Especially on the new high-speed route between Kassel and Fulda the going is quick and the overcast fall day and the dark tunnels swap places quickly, as if controlled by a child playing with a light switch.
<br><br>
  I arrived in Mannheim, where my friend Severin picked me up from the main station. Together we biked to a nice Ramen restaurant and had a lovely dinner. 
  Afterwards he dropped me back at the station and I got on the S2 to Kaiserslautern, the train started off fairly full and emptied less quickly than I had anticipated. 
<br><br>
  It’s truly dark now and there isn’t much to see outside of the windows. I look forward to waking up tomorrow and seeing where I am for the first time. 
<br><br>
  I emerge from the train at Neidenfels into a chilly night, I turn on all my lights and don some warmer clothes before biking along the river and then up into the mountains. 
  The flat bike path quickly gives way to steep leaf-covered forestry roads, and I soon remove the warmer layers as the climb intensifies.

<p>
  The trekking site appears to be in a very pretty ravine, and I quickly set up my tent and prepare myself for bed. 
  It’s been a day of mostly sitting in trains but I’m happy to get a small start to the cycling.

<p>
  Apart from the rustling of small animals in the undergrowth and the occasional falling leaf it’s quiet, and I’m ready to sleep. 
  We’ll see what tomorrow brings, I’m excited.

</p>

<p>
I wake up around 7 to the sounds of birdsong and the arhythmic dripping of fog from the trees. 
The whole forest is blanketed in mist giving it an intimate, hidden air. 
</p>

  <br>
<p>
I’m not feeling very hungry, so after one sandwich I start packing everything together to be on the road just after eight. 
<br>
The day starts off with a series of smaller climbs and descents through the forest, 
the mists get weaker the lower to the valley floor I go and the visibility improves, if only temporarily.

<p>
Soon I get to the biggest single climb of the trip. 10–12% is around my limit with the weight I have packed, 
and as the grade gets to 16–17% I need to get off and push. The steepest part only lasts a few hundred metres though, 
and I climb back into the low clouds. 
<br><br>
At the top I am greeted with an entry forbidden sign on the grounds of forestry work so I take the long way round to get to a small rest area where I eat a mid-morning snack.

<p>
I was going to leave Johanniskreuz on the state road, but I saw a sign for a bike route to the Heltersberg, a peak that was on my original route. 
I got about 7km in before I realized that this bike path wasn’t to the mountain Heltersberg, but to the town of the same name. 
Still, the bike path was very well kept (I think it was new) and I broke off down a section of the Brunnenwanderweg (Spring [Water Source] Hiking Trail).

<br>

<p>
A few climbs and descents later I arrive at Burg Gräfenstein. This will be my first sightseeing stop, the towers along the blocked road having been skipped.
<br>
Gräfenstein is a well-restored ruin, the walls completely encircle the keep, which is built on a huge chunk of red sandstone. The tower gives me a great view of the castle grounds, but not much else. 
The low clouds swallowing up any further views I may have hoped for. Suddenly the missed viewpoints don’t seem that big a deal.

<p>
From Gräfenstein it’s a short way to the next sight, the Teufelstisch (Devil’s Table), a sandstone slab balanced precariously at the top of a hill.

<br>

<p>
At last I completed the final climb into camp and got to work with dinner, afterwards I headed to the nearby spring to replenish my water and saw a light bobbing through the forest towards me. 
It was a hiker headed for the trekking camp and he looked completely finished. When I returned he had disappeared into his tent, not to re-emerge.

<br>

<p>
The thick mist drips from the trees and makes it sound like it’s raining, honestly it may as well be. Still I sit out in the forest reading. 
Enjoying the dark, soggy evening (it’s completely black and still only 18:30).

<p>
A group of three hikers arrived in the night around 23:00 and quickly set up their tent, I talked to them in the morning and apparently traffic had delayed their arrival considerably. 
They were hiking over the long weekend stringing together some of the other trekking sites. I also chatted to the solo hiker from last night, 
it turns out he had hiked from Wissembourg to Hauenstein in one day, no wonder he got here after sunset.
</p>

<br>
  
<p>
Another constant this morning was the fog, it remained heavy and nothing remained dry apart from the inside of my tent and bags. 
I decided to skip the planned pre-breakfast stop at a lookout and headed straight for the café in Hauenstein.
</p>

  <figcaption>"Descent to Hauenstein"</figcaption>
<br>

<p>
The descent into Hauenstein proved more harrowing than expected with the washed out road obscured by foliage, still I arrived unscathed and got myself a cherry pastry and a hot chocolate. 
Annoyingly, the café didn’t have any sandwiches, and the pictures of eggs on google proved to be a red herring. 
Luckily I had bought one salami sandwich too many the day before so I ate that on the wonderful bike path between Hauenstein and Lug. 
However, as a consequence I will have to save my Bananas for tomorrow.

<br>

<p>
After Lug I ascended to Burg Lindelbrunn, the castle is built high above the town and the only way up is a spiraling path up the hill. 
The castle is built directly into the sandstone hilltop and, although not as well-restored as Burg Gräfenstein, it was still very impressive. 
Not as impressive was the view, everything was completely obscured.
