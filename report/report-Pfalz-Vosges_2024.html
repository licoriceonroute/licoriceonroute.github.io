  <span class='dd'>Preface</span>
</h5>
<p>
  I’m waiting at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof for the ICE to Mannheim, thinking about my goals for this trip. Last September I biked from Erfurt to Bamberg through the Thüringian Forest and Franconian Switzerland, 
  experiencing the managed forests and pastoral landscapes, along with some interesting sights.
<br><br>
  This time I’m headed to the Palatinate Forest (Naturpark Pfälzerwald) and the northern Vosges Mountains (Parc naturel régional des Vosges du Nord), 
  a continuous area of forested medium mountains straddling the border between Germany and France. (According to the tourism boards of both regions—together it is the largest contiguous forest in Europe).
  </p>
    <br>

    <br>
  <p>
  I’ll start near the north of the forest and snake my way down south. On my way I hope to experience the nature of the forest along with the many castles, towers, and ruins scattered throughout the mountains. 
  Mostly I am drawn to the terrain—I know it will not disappoint—but I know from last year’s experience to take my time to enjoy the cultural sites as well. 
<br><br>
  I will camp the first three nights, the first two at trekking sites, the next at a hut in the Vosges. The last night I will stay with friends in Haguenau, France.
<br><br>
  I expect the cycling to be fairly difficult for me, once again leaving the flatland of northern Germany for a mountainous region. Every day will include a fair amount of elevation, 
  but I tried to balance Kilometers traveled and the surface I ride on: the rougher the terrain the shorter the distance. 
<br><br>
  I have a lot of food with me at the beginning as I won’t be able to buy anything Thursday or Friday. Thursday I will be away from any shopping possibilities, 
  and Friday is a public holiday in both Rheinland-Pfalz and Alsace. My main means of replenishment will be the one open bakery in Hauenstein the morning of day three. 
<br><br>
  I hope that the weather will be as good as forecast and that I will be able to beat the sunset every day except day one.
<br><br>
  My main goal is to get more comfortable with multi day travel and also with planning more diverse routes, as well as improving my knowledge of how my body reacts to lots of climbing and longer distances after a few days. 
  I don’t know if I’ll be able to check off everything, but I think I’ll gain some insights that I’ll be able to implement for future trips, especially when planning for regions I haven’t been to.

<p>
  As usual the ICE is well-booked, which I notice especially when it comes to the now-normalized dance between the reserved bike spots and the helpless parents with baby carriages, 
  searching for a place to park them. There isn’t much to do but hang my bike and sympathize with them over the lack of space.
<br><br>
  The Flat fields of the north soon give way to the hills of middle Germany. The ICE peeking out of tunnels for a brief view of small valley towns and forests, showing colourful signs of fall. 
  Especially on the new high-speed route between Kassel and Fulda the going is quick and the overcast fall day and the dark tunnels swap places quickly, as if controlled by a child playing with a light switch.
<br><br>
  I arrived in Mannheim, where my friend Severin picked me up from the main station. Together we biked to a nice Ramen restaurant and had a lovely dinner. 
  Afterwards he dropped me back at the station and I got on the S2 to Kaiserslautern, the train started off fairly full and emptied less quickly than I had anticipated. 
<br><br>
  It’s truly dark now and there isn’t much to see outside of the windows. I look forward to waking up tomorrow and seeing where I am for the first time. 
<br><br>
  I emerge from the train at Neidenfels into a chilly night, I turn on all my lights and don some warmer clothes before biking along the river and then up into the mountains. 
  The flat bike path quickly gives way to steep leaf-covered forestry roads, and I soon remove the warmer layers as the climb intensifies.

  <br>
<p>
  The trekking site appears to be in a very pretty ravine, and I quickly set up my tent and prepare myself for bed. 
  It’s been a day of mostly sitting in trains but I’m happy to get a small start to the cycling. 
</p>

  <br>
<p>
  Apart from the rustling of small animals in the undergrowth and the occasional falling leaf it’s quiet, and I’m ready to sleep. 
  We’ll see what tomorrow brings, I’m excited.

<p>
I wake up around 7 to the sounds of birdsong and the arhythmic dripping of fog from the trees. 
The whole forest is blanketed in mist giving it an intimate, hidden air. 
</p>
  <br>

  <br>
<p>
I’m not feeling very hungry, so after one sandwich I start packing everything together to be on the road just after eight. 
<br>
The day starts off with a series of smaller climbs and descents through the forest, 
the mists get weaker the lower to the valley floor I go and the visibility improves, if only temporarily.

  <br>
<p>
Soon I get to the biggest single climb of the trip. 10–12% is around my limit with the weight I have packed, 
and as the grade gets to 16–17% I need to get off and push. The steepest part only lasts a few hundred metres though, 
and I climb back into the low clouds. 
<br><br>
At the top I am greeted with an entry forbidden sign on the grounds of forestry work so I take the long way round to get to a small rest area where I eat a mid-morning snack.

<br>
  
<p>
I was going to leave Johanniskreuz on the state road, but I saw a sign for a bike route to the Heltersberg, a peak that was on my original route. 
I got about 7km in before I realized that this bike path wasn’t to the mountain Heltersberg, but to the town of the same name. 
Still, the bike path was very well kept (I think it was new) and I broke off down a section of the Brunnenwanderweg (Spring [Water Source] Hiking Trail).

<br>

<p>
A few climbs and descents later I arrive at Burg Gräfenstein. This will be my first sightseeing stop, the towers along the blocked road having been skipped.
<br>
Gräfenstein is a well-restored ruin, the walls completely encircle the keep, which is built on a huge chunk of red sandstone. The tower gives me a great view of the castle grounds, but not much else. 
The low clouds swallowing up any further views I may have hoped for. Suddenly the missed viewpoints don’t seem that big a deal.

<p>
From Gräfenstein it’s a short way to the next sight, the Teufelstisch (Devil’s Table), a sandstone slab balanced precariously at the top of a hill.

<p>
At last I completed the final climb into camp and got to work with dinner, afterwards I headed to the nearby spring to replenish my water and saw a light bobbing through the forest towards me. 
It was a hiker headed for the trekking camp and he looked completely finished. When I returned he had disappeared into his tent, not to re-emerge.

<p>
The thick mist drips from the trees and makes it sound like it’s raining, honestly it may as well be. Still I sit out in the forest reading. 
Enjoying the dark, soggy evening (it’s completely black and still only 18:30).

<p>
A group of three hikers arrived in the night around 23:00 and quickly set up their tent, I talked to them in the morning and apparently traffic had delayed their arrival considerably. 
They were hiking over the long weekend stringing together some of the other trekking sites. I also chatted to the solo hiker from last night, 
it turns out he had hiked from Wissembourg to Hauenstein in one day, no wonder he got here after sunset.
</p>

<br>
  
<p>
Another constant this morning was the fog, it remained heavy and nothing remained dry apart from the inside of my tent and bags. 
I decided to skip the planned pre-breakfast stop at a lookout and headed straight for the café in Hauenstein.
</p>

<br>

  <figcaption>Descent to Hauenstein</figcaption>
<br>

<p>
The descent into Hauenstein proved more harrowing than expected with the washed out road obscured by foliage, still I arrived unscathed and got myself a cherry pastry and a hot chocolate. 
Annoyingly, the café didn’t have any sandwiches, and the pictures of eggs on google proved to be a red herring. 
Luckily I had bought one salami sandwich too many the day before so I ate that on the wonderful bike path between Hauenstein and Lug. 
However, as a consequence I will have to save my Bananas for tomorrow.

<br>

<p>
After Lug I ascended to Burg Lindelbrunn, the castle is built high above the town and the only way up is a spiraling path up the hill. 
The castle is built directly into the sandstone hilltop and, although not as well-restored as Burg Gräfenstein, it was still very impressive. 
Not as impressive was the view, everything was completely obscured.
</p>

<br>

<p>
I left the Castle with a long descent, getting into the valley of the Klingbach. 
The cycle path here was excellent along the stream and I made good time, passing Burg Landeck high above, and emerging from the forest and into wine country.

<p>
The wine fields were beautiful despite—or maybe as a result of—the weather. 
Yellows, oranges, browns, and reds covered the landscape in a patchwork of differing grape vines. 
The small towns I passed through had many Fachwerkhäuser, some adorned with grapevines. 
At the border between the Pfalz and Alsace there is the German Wine Gate, just beyond comes France. 
<br>
Just behind the border is the picturesque town of Wissembourg. 
The streets here are still full of (mostly German) tourists and I stop for a bite to eat before continuing through the streets. 
I’ve been here before, but it’s a while ago and I don’t recognize much. 
The few memories I have are mostly of the canals that cross through the town.

<br>

<p>
The tight alleys and curving streets lead me out to the city wall, and then along the canal to the riverside bike path. 
<br>
I followed the paved path for a while, meeting for the first time other bike tourists. 
They were all older, mostly on e-bikes, and without bags. 
Later on the road I would cross ways with two younger bikepackers, some vindication at least that these bike paths are not only for retirees.
<br>
As sunset drew ever closer I faced a choice: keep going to the campsite and eat dinner while I had light, or visit the Château Fleckenstein. 
I went with the latter, and discovered a beautiful castle again built into a sandstone outcropping high above the valley. 
My decision-making may have been influenced by a fleck of blue sky, and the partial lifting of the mists. 
It proved a good choice, this was my first real view of the forests below.

The castle was bustling with young families, this was the first castle I had seen with interactive exhibits geared towards children and it seemed to work. 
<br>
I descended from the castle only to climb back out of the valley on the other side for the last ascent of the day. 
The final push was a hike-a-bike up a short hiking path that ended right at the shelter.

<p>
As I made dinner I looked out at the view I hadn’t had time to enjoy before sundown: across the valley to Château Froensbourg. 
Some dim beams betrayed the headlamps of people exploring after dark, and a while later I saw the flickering of a campfire. 
My camera was able to capture this high-resolution photo, drumroll please…

After I had eaten I sat out a while in my chair enjoying my book and writing before heading to sleep, 
ready for the long day tomorrow, but most of all the shower at the end of it.

The omnipresent mists have disappeared and from my spot I can see the Château Froensbourg across the forest. 
I don’t want to eat at camp, but will wait until Obersteinbach where there is a Maison de Randonneurs offering a daytime refuge for cycle tourists. 
<br>
The path towards the Château is a puzzle, as the crisscrossing paths change from forestry roads into single track and back. 
Still after some carrying I reach the precariously situated castle. 
The long thin cliff it is built into offers many nooks and crannies, and in one there are four people still in their sleeping bags, I am careful not to wake them up. 
</p>

<p>
The rest of the ride into the valley is again on the classic forestry roads, although they seem rougher here than in Germany. 
I reach the road and head towards Obersteinbach, only to find the Maison closed. 
A neighbour tells me they were having issues with garbage and cleanliness; I eat my breakfast in the street.
<br>
I continue on, refilling my bottles at public fountains in Nieder- and Obersteinbach. 
When I reach the first planned route through the forest I am greeted with the first of many signs I will see today marked « Chasse en Cours » “Hunting in Progress”.

<p>
With the majority of forestry roads blocked by hunters I decide to take only the paved roads through the forest and of course also the main high roads. 
The first section directs me through the military camp at Bitche, I’m not sure if the shots I’ve been hearing all morning are from the hunters or the soldiers. I suspect both. 
<br>
Small hills give character to the otherwise fairly straight road, and I arrive quickly in Bitche, immediately spotting the Citadelle looming above the town. 
Although I had double-checked the opening times last week, the Citadelle is closed until 18:00 when it reopens for a special evening event. 
Sadly I can’t wait that long and have to satisfy myself with a scenic orbit all around the walls.

The Café Nacional in Bitche however, was open. 
Inside I ordered a hot chocolate and an orangina; the stark outsider among retired men enjoying their morning beers or stronger. 
They clearly all knew each other and no hand was left unshaken whenever someone arrived or left. 
The atmosphere was subdued, conversations were held softly in pairs, in a smattering of different German and French dialects. 
I can understand the comfort the regulars might get from this place.
<br>
The route from Bitche to Lemberg is an absolute highlight, first taking a little-used forest road before continuing onto a true cycle path through the colourful trees. 
I’m not sure what the original use was, the gradients are much to steep for it to be an old railway, still I was sorry to get to the end of its many climbs and descend out of Lemberg again.

The way from Lemberg to Mouterhouse was one long descent, and I reached my maximum speed here at 56kph without pedaling. 
Waiting for me at the bottom was the Grand Étang Moderbach, and at the Inn there were a multitude of hunters in their orange garb.
</p>

<br>

<p>
On the climb out of Mouterhouse a Land Rover with two freshly shot wild boar on the bumper drove past, and I could hear more shots as I took the way to Melch. 
The forest paths on either side were all staked out with the now familiar « Chasse en Cours ». 
<br>
Melch lay in the pastoral Melcher valley, the ride there marked by fields broken up by fish ponds, where sheep and horses grazed.

In Reipertsviller I had to make a choice. 
Going left would mean taking the easier but busier road with less elevation change, while going right would take me up to the Château de Lichtenberg and then down through the quiet Weinbaechel valley. 
Feeling game, I struck out for the castle and climbed up to the gate only to find it also shut until 18:00. 
Commiserating with some other tourists, I took a walk once around as I had in Bitche, and also had a nice conversation with a former Parisian schoolteacher who had come to Alsace for his retirement.

The last descent down the single trail and along the Weinbaechel was soon over, and I found myself out of the Vosges and on “flat” land. 
My way took me through some villages and muddy fields before I reached the Moder and followed it to Haguenau. 
Other thin tracks proved I wasn’t the only idiot to cycle through the cloying mud, just the most recent.

At long last I reached Haguenau and with it Eloise and Franc’s, where I enjoyed a much needed shower and they prepared a lovely dinner.

After a trip to the Art de Pain Roller and a breakfast of Patisseries and Viennoiseries (Eloise explained the differences) I bade my friends farewell and set off through the flat forest trails north of Haguenau. 
I was intent on not missing my train, and soon I crossed the Rhine into Germany, biking down the suburban Cycleways of Rastatt to the city centre. 
This last part of the journey also brought the first clear sunny skies of the trip, and I relished the blue of the sky against the changing leaves.

<!-- thoughts-->
  
<h5>
  <span class='dd'>Thoughts</span>
</h5>

<p>
Racing north I reflect on my trip. 
The past few days were not without their challenges, but I had prepared well and didn’t have any major difficulties. 
The biggest immediate issues were the road closures—whether for forestry work or hunting—the only way around that would be to go earlier in the year. 
Still the time of year was perfect for biking and enjoying the area without too many other tourists.
<br>
The biggest limitation was amount of daylight, that really limited how much time I could spend off the bike and exploring. 
Biking in the dark on the first night was alright, but it would have been irritating to do every day. 
<br>
I have improved my understanding of my limits and when I‘m about to reach them and how to counteract it. 
The climbing went fairly well, if slowly at times, I could certainly lose a few kilos from my packs, and drop the heavier food. 
Still I enjoyed having my camp chair with me to sit in at night, it might be worth getting an even lighter one for the future trips, or just leaving it at home if gradients and culmulative elevation are too high. 
I have managed to cut down a bit on my kit from last year so that’s something at least. 
<br>
While crossing the Rhine I saw the outline of the Schwarzwald in the distance, which I will certainly need to bike through in the future.
<br>
The weather didn’t bother me, on the contrary, and I had enough gear should it have turned For the worse. 
Drinking water didn’t end up being an issue, but for the future I should carry aqua tabs or similarly lightweight and fast-acting water treatment, taste be damned.
<br>
I wonder if there is a law in the Vosges that your house must be either beige, cream, or off-white. 
I do like the brightly painted shutters though. A contrast to Toulouse where the houses are livelier and the shutters pale blue.
<br>
Normally I am rarely, if ever, spoken to in the train or otherwise. 
Whereas, with a packed bicycle people come out of their shells and there is always someone interested.
On that note: the French cyclists, joggers, and dog-walkers were much more likely to greet me on my way by, by contrast in Germany it’s a crapshoot whether anyone will respond at all, or just look away.
<br>
I was surprised at the density of castles in the area, so close that many could directly see one another. 
It’s incredible that the region was rich enough to allow so much construction. Another surprise was that in all of the old paintings and depictions of the castles, the surroundings are all fields. 
The forests didn’t exist then to the degree they do today.
<br>
All in all, despite the early sundowns and closed roads I had a lovely time in this part of Europe. 
I look forward to returning to some of the places I missed, and also exploring further south in the Vosges du Sud.
