<h1>Pfalz-Vosges</h1>
<h2>Oct. 30th - Nov. 3rd 2024</h2>

  <span class='dd'>Preface</span>
</p>
<p>
  I’m waiting at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof for the ICE to Mannheim, thinking about my goals for this trip. Last September I biked from Erfurt to Bamberg through the Thüringian Forest and Franconian Switzerland, 
  experiencing the managed forests and pastoral landscapes, along with some interesting sights.
<br><br>
  This time I’m headed to the Palatinate Forest (Naturpark Pfälzerwald) and the northern Vosges Mountains (Parc naturel régional des Vosges du Nord), 
  a continuous area of forested medium mountains straddling the border between Germany and France. (According to the tourism boards of both regions—together it is the largest contiguous forest in Europe).
  </p>

  <p>
  I’ll start near the north of the forest and snake my way down south. On my way I hope to experience the nature of the forest along with the many castles, towers, and ruins scattered throughout the mountains. 
  Mostly I am drawn to the terrain—I know it will not disappoint—but I know from last year’s experience to take my time to enjoy the cultural sites as well. 
<br><br>
  I will camp the first three nights, the first two at trekking sites, the next at a hut in the Vosges. The last night I will stay with friends in Haguenau, France.
<br><br>
  I expect the cycling to be fairly difficult for me, once again leaving the flatland of northern Germany for a mountainous region. Every day will include a fair amount of elevation, 
  but I tried to balance Kilometers traveled and the surface I ride on: the rougher the terrain the shorter the distance. 
<br><br>
  I have a lot of food with me at the beginning as I won’t be able to buy anything Thursday or Friday. Thursday I will be away from any shopping possibilities, 
  and Friday is a public holiday in both Rheinland-Pfalz and Alsace. My main means of replenishment will be the one open bakery in Hauenstein the morning of day three. 
<br><br>
  I hope that the weather will be as good as forecast and that I will be able to beat the sunset every day except day one.
<br><br>
  My main goal is to get more comfortable with multi day travel and also with planning more diverse routes, as well as improving my knowledge of how my body reacts to lots of climbing and longer distances after a few days. 
  I don’t know if I’ll be able to check off everything, but I think I’ll gain some insights that I’ll be able to implement for future trips, especially when planning for regions I haven’t been to.

  As usual the ICE is well-booked, which I notice especially when it comes to the now-normalized dance between the reserved bike spots and the helpless parents with baby carriages, 
  searching for a place to park them. There isn’t much to do but hang my bike and sympathize with them over the lack of space.
<br><br>
  The Flat fields of the north soon give way to the hills of middle Germany. The ICE peeking out of tunnels for a brief view of small valley towns and forests, showing colourful signs of fall. 
  Especially on the new high-speed route between Kassel and Fulda the going is quick and the overcast fall day and the dark tunnels swap places quickly, as if controlled by a child playing with a light switch.
<br><br>
  I arrived in Mannheim, where my friend Severin picked me up from the main station. Together we biked to a nice Ramen restaurant and had a lovely dinner. 
  Afterwards he dropped me back at the station and I got on the S2 to Kaiserslautern, the train started off fairly full and emptied less quickly than I had anticipated. 
<br><br>
  It’s truly dark now and there isn’t much to see outside of the windows. I look forward to waking up tomorrow and seeing where I am for the first time. 
<br><br>
  I emerge from the train at Neidenfels into a chilly night, I turn on all my lights and don some warmer clothes before biking along the river and then up into the mountains. 
  The flat bike path quickly gives way to steep leaf-covered forestry roads, and I soon remove the warmer layers as the climb intensifies.

The trekking site appears to be in a very pretty ravine, and I quickly set up my tent and prepare myself for bed. 
  It’s been a day of mostly sitting in trains but I’m happy to get a small start to the cycling.

<p>
  Apart from the rustling of small animals in the undergrowth and the occasional falling leaf it’s quiet, and I’m ready to sleep. 
  We’ll see what tomorrow brings, I’m excited.
