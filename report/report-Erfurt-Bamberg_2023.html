<h1>Erfurt-Bamberg</h1>
<h2>September 17th - 22nd 2023</h2>





<!-- preface-->

</h5>
<p>
	I decided on this trip after much grumbling on my part about the lack of wild camping and wilderness in Germany.
<br><br>
	To prove myself wrong I planned a tour through the Thüringer Wald, Frankenwald, and the Fränkische Schweiz.
	These are forests and natural reserves in the heart of Germany, and while they are not wilderness as I would 
	define it, I am excited to see what the landscape here has to offer. I will be camping every night, three times 
	at multi-use campgrounds and twice at more isolated trekking sites..

	Although the main goal of this trip is to attempt to connect to the natural side, I also decided to embrace 
	the possibilities offered by bicycle touring. Visiting museums, castles, restaurants, and cultural touchstones 
	as I pass through this – to me – as yet unknown part of Europe.

<p>
Having packed the bike the night before, I got away early. Making a quick stop at the bakery to pick up 
some breakfast before taking the S-Bahn to Altona.
<br>
The ICE was empty when I secured my bike, but filled up once it got to the main station.

  <br>
  <br>
<p>
This is my first time travelling with my bike by ICE, and although you have to reserve far in advance for the bike spots, 
the ride once on board is much less stressful than the regional trains.
<br><br>
Starting out from Erfurt in the early afternoon proved to be a mistake, the sun was already baking and although it’s 
mid September it was almost thirty degrees. The only respite was the cool wafts from the Gera river whose trail formed 
the backbone of this day’s ride.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Passing through the small towns I start noticing that I’m entering the slate mountain region of Thüringen 
(Schiefergebirge).
<br>
Many houses and every church are clad in slate shingles.
</p>

<br>
    <a href="https://licoriceonroute.github.io/file/image/Erfurt-Bamberg_2023/Day_1/Slate.JPG">

<br>
<p>
The exposure on the climb out of the Gera valley was brutal, with the sun beating down and not a breath of wind.
That, combined with the weight of the equipment and a gradient I was not at all used to, really put me to the test.
<br>
In the end it took me 45 minutes, and I had to take breaks when my heartrate got too high.
</p>

<br>

<p>
The reward after a day in the heat was a dip in the local community pool (freibad). The water was frigid, but 
helped to avoid heatstroke and cool me down properly.
For dinner I got some sausages, potato salad, and later peanuts followed along with a few lemonades at the snack bar.
</p>

<br>


<p>
I talked a little with some of the locals, one of whom was an avid mountain biker. He offered to host me in his garden 
in the next town overif I ever returned to these parts, but for today the only biking I would do was downhill to the 
campsite I had booked.
<br>
Having skipped past the campground earlier to get some food I pedaled back and set up my tent shortly after sundown. 
Lying in the tent I contemplate the climb out of this valley in the morning. Tomorrow holds a lot more elevation, 
and even though there isn’t a single climb harder than the one today, there will be many more of them. 
<br><br>
It’s quiet now, only the nocturnal birds and the small stream next to the campground provide a calm soundtrack 
to the otherwise silent night.

<p>
After a fairly restless night I’m awoken by rain on the tent. It’s not a downpour, but it certainly saps my 
resolve to leave its shelter. The damp clothes from yesterday don’t do much to help either.
</p>

<br>

  <figcaption>Gravel in the fields</figcaption>
<br>
  
<p>
After a quick breakfast I head across the fields on a narrow gravel trail and up into the first climb It’s 
not as terribly demanding as I feared and I push through to the top, following a ribbon of asphalt 
that meanders along a stream.
<br><br>
Once at the top I leave the road for a bit to ride some of the Rennsteig hiking trail.
</p>

<br>
    <a href="https://licoriceonroute.github.io/file/image/Erfurt-Bamberg_2023/Day_2/Banana.JPG">

  <figcaption>Rennsteig meadows and the banana strap holding strong</figcaption>
<br>

<p>
The overcast sky and intermittent drizzle makes the climbs that much easier, although the blustery headwind 
does slow me down a little. 
<br><br>
The road on this part of the course is smooth and fast, so I take lunch in a shelter as the drizzle continues.

<br>

<p>
Soon after lunch I left the paved streets to the cars and took to the forest paths. The nature reserves only make 
up a portion of today's route and outside of them large patches of firs have been logged. Many stands were also dead, 
I assume as a consequence of the same bark beetle whose swathes of destruction I witnessed while hiking in the Elbe 
Sandstone Mountains of Saxony (Elbsandsteingebirge) this spring. Luckily it seems that the wildfires that ravaged 
there did not find hold in these forests.

<p>
The logging roads took me through the forests and out onto a road on the mountainside. This road was obviously 
brand new as the gravel was very fresh and awful to bike on. The rain picked up again here and I changed into my cold 
weather gear: tights, hat, buff, rain jacket, fleece gloves. Necessary as it turns out, it only got colder from there. 
</p>

<p>
After leaving the teeth-chattering gravel behind the path turned into a single trail which curved up into the clouds. 
The constant climbs seem to have started causing some discomfort around my knee, hopefully that will improve somewhat 
with the lighter days ahead.
</p>

<br>

<p>
A number of harrowing descents followed, not least of which was on the single worst trail I have ever seen. 
The holes in the concrete were the right width and depth to easily cause a flat and the centre was a catastrophe 
in its own right. Luckily the rain had stopped and it even cleared up a bit.

<p>
I was glad when I finally reached the trekking site and enjoyed a nice view with my dinner. The sun came out for 
the first time all day as a sort of goodbye, and soon disappeared once more into the gathering clouds.
<br>
The wind is picking up and the crickets are chirping. I’m the only one at the trekking site which makes it seem 
all the more remote and peaceful.

<p>
I leave the campsite with the sun peeking through the clouds every now and then, lifting my spirits despite 
my sore knee. Beginning the day with a 250m descent over 3km it certainly helps to wake me up if I wasn’t already. 
Nearly the whole way I have the Castle Lauenstein in view, it’s not open yet but the perch on a hill in the middle 
of village is impressive. The next town, Ludwigsstadt, is in a deep valley and an old railway bridge dominates its 
“skyline” along with the slate clad church steeple.
</p>

<br>

<p>
If yesterday was dominated by the logging industry, today it is slate. After leaving Ludwigsstadt my route takes me 
up a few climbs and straight through an active slate quarry. The outs on either side of the ‘road’ were so deep I 
couldn’t see the bottom.
</p>

<br>

  alt="Deep square quarry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>
  <figcaption>New slate quarry</figcaption>
<br>

<p>
Past that I arrived at the old slate quarry, higher up in the mountains. It has been disused since the 1960s and 
now serves as a museum.
<br>
Quarried slate contains only about 10% quality stone, of which another 30-40% is lost to the manufacturing process. 
All in all about 93% of the quarried stone ends up as refuse.
<br>
Some uses for non-quality slate exist, such as for walls or rough paving stones, but today the most prevalent use 
is for road filler.
</p>

<br>
    <a href="https://licoriceonroute.github.io/file/image/Erfurt-Bamberg_2023/Day_3/Workshop.JPG">
  <img src="https://licoriceonroute.github.io/file/image/Erfurt-Bamberg_2023/compressed/c_Day_3/c_Workshop.jpg" 
  alt="Workshop with slate roof and walls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>
  <figcaption>The old workshop: here we see the quality slate as shingles and the rest as the stones for the wall.</figcaption>
<br>

<p>
While in the museum I learned a few interesting facts about slate manufacturing.
<br>
The slate is first split into thin sheets and then formed into the desired shape with large table shears, 
if not in a workshop it can also be formed with a special hammer.
<br>
The silica dust that comes from working in a slate workshop is very detrimental to your health. Slate splitters 
could only be expected to reach the age of 45.
<br>
For writing slate the slate for the board is normal single fault slate and the slate for the ‘pencil’ is 
double-faulted and also much softer, making it otherwise unusable. Slate for writing boards needs to be sanded down, 
this was work for the winter inside with the whole family (remember the dust?).
</p>

<br>
    <a href="https://licoriceonroute.github.io/file/image/Erfurt-Bamberg_2023/Day_3/Lift.JPG">

  alt="Lift house clad in slate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>
  <figcaption>The old lift house</figcaption>
<br>

<p>
The lift house is probably the most impressive remaining building on the property. It housed the machines 
that lifted the stone out of the quarry and also the pumps to keep it dry.
</p>

  alt="Old quarry filled with water" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>
  <figcaption>The quarry, now a lake</figcaption>
<br>

<p>
In the early 2000s it was decided to stop pumping the water out of the quarry and now all that can be seen is a lake. 
The lake itself reaches 45m deep, above the water there is another about 25-30m until the top of the excavation.
</p>

  alt="2 metre tall houses with slate roofs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>
  <figcaption>Masterpieces</figcaption>
<br>

<p>
While this may look like a model town, each one is the ‘Meisterwerk’ (Masterpiece) of a slate roofing apprentice. 
Once completed they are considered masters of their work and are free to start on their own. Slate roofs have somewhat 
fallen out of favour, replaced by cheaper, less labour-intensive styles (one replacement even included epoxy-bound 
slate powder mixed with asbestos). Now slate roofs only affix churches, town halls, and the homes of the wealthy – 
or those who live in a town where it is officially required, as it commonly is in this region.
<br><br>
Although slate is fairly soft (3 on the Mohs hardness scale) it is otherwise very resilient. A slate roof can last 
for up to 600 years before it needs to be replaced. Other uses for slate I saw were as writing slate, chemically 
stable tables for laboratories, sinks, toilet seats, grave stones and many further uses I wouldn’t have thought of.
<br><br>
Leaving the slate quarry behind I break towards my lunch reservation at the Hotel Post in Nordhalben, here I enjoy 
a quiet meal of Haxe Osso Buco, Klöße, Rotkraut, and a local beer. On the wall I spy a certificate dated 2008 from 
the brewery, congratulating the restaurant on 200 unbroken years of serving their beer. 
That would make this partnership an impressive 215 years old.
<br>
It wasn’t easy to tear myself away from the table, but I continued my route down winding forest paths to the 
reservoir for a post-lunch snack break and for the first time in two days it was truly sunny.

<p>
The control room for the reservoir rests atop a column in the middle of the water. It appears that the only way to 
reach it is the pontoon boat tied up on the shore.

<p>
The final point of interest was a natural spring of sparkling water. It was a great novelty to me to drink sparkling 
water straight out of the ground, until now I’d only had it out of the supermarket. It seemed that the spring water 
was sought after, as I set about departing a man pulled up in his car with a case of empty bottles to be refilled.
<br><br>
Charged and refreshed by the spring, I tackled the final climb and reached the site. The sun remained out long enough 
for me to quickly set up my tent and dry out the fly that was still wet with Monday morning’s dew. 
</p>

  <figcaption>Finally dry</figcaption>
<br>

<p>
Here in the middle of the forest this site is much better protected than the exposure I experienced last night, and 
before the sun said its goodbye I set about replacing the calories I had lost.
<br><br>
My education in the world of slate wasn’t to be the only novel knowledge I would finish the day with. Apparently 
sunflowers contain chlorogenic acid, which turns green when mixed with an alkaline substance such as my Laugenstange.

<p>
The cool night rolled in and I stayed outside for a while reading before retiring to the tent, pleased with today 
and excited for tomorrow.

<p>
Dawn cut through the trees as I was already taking down the tent with a certain reluctance. I had planned today as 
a kind of transfer between the two mountainous regions of Frankenwald and Fränkisch Schweiz, therefore a fair 
chunk of the day would be spent next to or on high-traffic roads in the unspectacular wide valley between. 
</p>

  <figcaption>The wide valleys stand out clearly</figcaption>
<br>

<p>
I did not foresee that the first hour of the day would be perhaps my favourite hour spent on a bike. Cutting out of 
the forest onto a fine gravel path which rose across the tops of the hills until it descended, getting chunkier and 
steeper eventually flattening out at the bottom of the valley where a asphalt cycleway danced around the curves of a 
stream.

<p>
After the cycle path left the stream it was only next to a highway and fields, I took a quick look into Kronach 
for a break and made a note to return in the future. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
From Kronach it was a straight shot down through the wide valley, this was mostly farmland punctuated with a few 
very picturesque towns. The temperature rose to 26°C, and without shade it was baking.
</p>

<p>
The climb out of the valley was luckily shaded and if it wasn’t already apparent from the change in architecture, 
this cemented my arrival in sandstone country.

<p>
Finally I arrived in Franconian Switzerland, the last few kilometres through the fields led me to the campsite 
for the evening, in a small valley next to a stream and a road (apparently beloved by motorcyclists). I look 
forward to the local cuisine in the nearby restaurant!

<p>
Today was another tourist day like day 3, not as far distance-wise but with a lot of punchy climbs to get to the sights.
<br><br>
The day started out easy enough on a very well-planned bike path through the fields, and along a river.
</p>

<p>
I reluctantly left it for some badly maintained singletrack and a chunky gravel track up through a small wood and 
around a corn field. This was the way to the first castle, Burg Rabenstein, which was closed today as someone had 
rented it.
</p>

<p>
Next up was Burg Pottenstein, I hadn’t really planned on visiting it, but when I saw it from the opposite mountainside 
I decided to make the climb. Perched atop an overhanging cliff it makes for a very impressive sight.

<p>
After leaving Pottenstein I sped back into the valley towards my next destination, the limestone caverns of the 
Teufelshöhle (Devil’s Cave). 
<br>
I’d never been in a cave like this before and I was very impressed by the formations I found within. 
</p>

<p>
By this time it was truly hot, nearing 30°, but I kept up the pace across the plateau towards Gößweinstein.
<br>
It lies across the valley from tonight’s campsite and as excited as I was to set up my tent, when I saw the town 
from afar, I had to make the climb up to the castle and basilica. I felt underfed and thirsty, so halfway up I 
stopped at a supermarket and scarfed down some cheese and sausages in the parking lot. The castle was then 
explored with Fritz Rhubarb Lemonade in hand.

I finally got to eat the long awaited meal. When asked what I should do in Franken, my friend from the region 
only gave two answers: less importantly to ride along the river Wiesent (today and tomorrow) and most importantly 
to eat Schäufele at the Gasthaus zum Pfaffenstein. So I did; pork shoulder complete from the blade to crisped skin, 
soft meat and gooey fat, accompanied as always with a Kloß, and as a side a classic pickled salad.    
</p>

  <br>
  
  <p>
  The rain is going to come in tonight and stay until tomorrow morning. I’m not looking forward to starting the day 
  in the wet, but I am willing to sacrifice and pack up wet stuff as it is the last day.

<p>
The wind bows in my tent at around midnight and the rain lashes in soon after. Everything holds well enough and 
the storm is spent in around an hour. It rains intermittently throughout the night but the rain holds off enough 
for me to pack everything and be on my way. It is a pleasure to descend the steep roads I was forced to tackle 
yesterday on my way up to the campsite.
<br><br>
In the valley below flows the Wiesent, and my route takes me alongside it for a good while, both flowing downhill 
in the morning mist.

Along the banks the rocky outcroppings jut imposingly above the valley, making it the perfect place for a 
castle if one was to be so inclined.

The rest of the day passed in a smattering of riverside cycleways and forested singletracks until I got to the 
top of the last climb. From there the fine gravel stretched all the way to the outskirts of Bamberg, and all I 
had to do was steer. I didn’t pedal for 11 minutes, in that time I descended 242m and it poured rain the whole while.

Bamberg is a beautiful city, problem is a lot of other people seem to think so too. After a week of no crowds 
of any kind it was a little much, I saw some sights before retiring to a secluded park.

The rain started again, so I popped into a cafe for some tea and cake to wait it out before heading to the 
train station and leaving for home.

<p>
As I sit here in the train I ask myself if I achieved my goals. 
<br><br>
Even though I couldn’t find true wilderness here, I hadn’t expected to. What I did discover was a new way to 
appreciate nature, and a new way to experience its challenges.
<br><br>
The Thüringer Wald, the Frankenwald, and the Fränkische Schweiz were everything I expected and more. I look 
forward to coming back with more time to explore, and maybe also someone to share it with.
<br><br>
The biggest question I hadn’t asked myself was one I hardly dared to.
Do I even like bike touring?
Now that I’ve finished this short tour I feel that I can finally answer: yes.
There are a lot of things I can change for the future that I took away from this trip, and I look forward to 
learning even more the next time. This trip convinced me that I want to do another, longer tour on my own, 
but equally that I want to do one with company.
<br><br>
Now that everything is done with, I can also finally say it – through all the gravel, sharp stones, questionable 
descents, and curb hops over 330km and 5000m vert – 
<br>
<b>I DIDN'T GET A SINGLE FLAT TIRE!</b>
