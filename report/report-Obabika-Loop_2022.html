<p>
	After being away for so many years I really wanted to come back to Canada in the summer, 
	especially to visit the canadian shield. 
	I've always loved it, but living away for so long has given me a new appreciation for the rocks, 
	the lakes, and the solitude. My favourite way to experience it has always been from the water, so 
	what better	activity to do than a canoe trip with some friends.
	<br><br>
	After doing a lot of research, and timing it with everyone's schedules, we settled on the easily accessible, 
	and beginner-friendly Obabika Loop in the Temagami Canoe Area of southeastern Ontario. 
	<br><br>
	Our group consisted of Hudson, Graeme, Stefan, and myself. Hudson and Graeme had done a canoe trip together 
	at summer camp before, so were experienced with the demands of multi-day canoeing.
	<br>
	Stefan and I had gone on a multi-day Kayak trip in Georgian Bay in 2016, the last time I was here in the summer. so
	he also knew what he was getting into.
	<br><br>
	Everyone was looking forward to the trip, and we planned everything online so we would be prepared when I arrived.
	<br><br>
	We borrowed some important packing gear from Rolf, and a second tent from Wendy, 
	so lots of thanks goes out to them.

<p>
Even though we had done a test-pack the night before, we did a final pack with all the food and left after Hudson's 
work to drive from Toronto to Smoothwater Outfitters.
  <br>
	Shortly after North Bay we got a pressure warning light in the car. 
	We got to the outfitter around 01:30 and Hudson kindly announced our arrival with a friendly honk. 
	We pitched the tents in the dark as quickly as possible and got to sleep around 02:00.

  <br><br>
  After deeming all the permanent seating in the station to be inadequate, we set up our camping chairs next to an out 
  of the way window and had a relaxing wait with Wendy offering up some Jam up the Mash and a third of the birthday 
  cake allowance we had for the week.

<p>
	Waking up on time for breakfast we entered the lodge for eggs, toast, fruit, bacon, and coffee at 08:00. 
	At the table we met a physics teacher and his family visiting their eldest daughter at smoothwater and had 
	a very nice conversation with him. We got outfitted with our canoes, bear barrel, and other accessories 
	before driving a little ways down the highway to the Red Squirrel logging Road. The road proved to be rough 
	and consisted primarily of sharp gravel as well as larger rocks, the fine dust immediately coated everything 
	outside of the car, and the bushes and flowers on the embankments were all white with cloying powder.
</p>

	<br>

  <br>

<p>
The tire that had had the low pressure warning the night before and had seemed fine this morning gave 
out around four kilometres into the road. Changing it for a spare on the side of the road was challenging 
with the logging trucks going past, some stopped to ask if we were alright while others rumbled by, 
barely slowing down, causing us to stick our heads under the canoes to avoid the thick clouds that 
obscured the road for half a minute at a time.
</p>

  <br>
  
<p>
After changing the ruined tire we took a very careful drive to the put-in. 
The parking lot was 1.12km from the beach on Sandy Inlet, and the portage took us first down a rough road, 
impossible for us to drive down, and then a placid forest path. Most of the cars in the parking lot nearer 
the beach were serious offroaders, but some, like a Honda Odyssey, showed their drivers had either 
incredible talent or complete disregard for damage. 
</p>

  <br>

<p>
We paddled to the Pickerel Bay portage in around an hour and there found a path characterized by a 
treacherous 20m long section of broken stones and jagged rocks making it the most difficult part of 
this portage, we were sure however that there would be more difficult portages to come.
<br><br>
Having completed our first water to water portage we quickly crossed the North Arm of Lake Temagami 
and picked our way through the narrow passages into southern Sharp Rock Bay, intent on finding a campsite there. 
With all of them either occupied or inaccessible we decided to head north towards the Sharp Rock Portage and 
search for a site among the cluster of three up there.
<br><br>
Taking the easternmost we had a great dinner of steak, snap peas, onions, and potatoes cooked over an open fire. 
</p>

<p>
The drab sky eventually gave way to a beautiful overcast sunset and as the sun went down the stars 
slowly crept out from behind the clouds.
We fell asleep to the loon calls and the lapping of waves on the rocks.

<p>
	Expecting rain I woke up at 05:00 to a clear and starry night; the air was cool but we all stayed warm 
	enough in our sleeping bags. The situation at 07:00 looked very different however, with clouds looming 
	in from the west.
</p>

<p>
We tried to get a fire going as quickly as possible and to get the tents down before the rain started, 
not soon enough as it turned out, as a drizzle started just as breakfast was getting underway. 
We took the dry inners into a dry sack and stuffed the wet flys in another.
</p>

  <br>

<p>
A delicious breakfast of scrambled eggs with tomatoes in a pot and bacon fried on a sheet of foil followed, 
and after we had cleared up breakfast the rains stopped as we departed towards the Sharp Rock Portage.
<br><br>
A lift over a beaver dam was required to get into the most westerly inlet of Sharp Rock Bay just before the 
Sharp Rock Portage, which lived up to its name. Luckily it was very short and we quickly continued into 
Diamond Lake, quickly fishing three leeches out of the bottom of the canoe before heading off.
</p>

  <figcaption>Pre-Portage Lift-Over</figcaption>
  <br>

<p>
Diamond Lake proved to be very pretty and completely deserted apart from a float plane dropping people 
off at a cabin. Paddling Diamond Lake without the headwind of which I had been warned seemed like appropriate 
compensation for the wet morning.
</p>

<p>
We took a small detour into the Bob Lake Conservation Reserve; deciding against paddling in, 
we made BLT wraps with the leftover bacon from breakfast. The next leg would be our last of the day 
as we headed west to look for a campsite, but not before Stefan soaked Hudson with the splash from a well thrown rock.
<br><br>
The campsite of the day was high up on the rocks giving us a great view of the surrounding scenery.

  <br>

<p>
A small jumping rock was found and the swimming was great in the deep water off the eastern side, 
Stefan and Graeme tried their luck fishing, but to no avail. A beaver also greeted us, swimming by 
twice in the afternoon sun.

  <br>

<p>
Dinner would be hotdogs, peppers, and zucchini grilled over the fire, and we sat out by the flames 
until the rain started up. It strengthened steadily until it settled into a downpour and we fell asleep 
to the sound of rain on the tents and the highlights of the Jays game on the radio.

<p>
The rain let up in the early morning, but it left the tents and the ground damp. We were dry enough though 
and crawled out to face a blustery and overcast morning.
<br><br>
We made a quick breakfast of oats with dried fruit and nuts, as well as some hard boiled eggs, before taking 
the tents down and striking out onto the cold water. The agreed morning swim would have to wait but seeing 
two loons on the lake right next to the boats was a nice bonus.
<br><br>
Paddling the rest of the west arm of Diamond Lake, the sun made its first appearance of the day around noon. 
We made our way into the final muddy bay but it took a while to find the portage route as the path split off 
in two directions
</p>

  <br>

  <br>

<p>
This first 400m portage proved to be the most difficult of the trip, consisting of many large boulder 
fields and several rock “staircases” that took some careful foot placement to navigate. The portage may 
have been difficult but it was also very picturesque, having us lug our gear across the lip of a cliff 
overlooking a forest and the stony creek beyond.
<br><br>
The paddle across Lain Lake was very short and after pulling our canoes up we found a much more agreeable 
portage along a disused logging road and a short, clear forest path. We were passed on these by two other canoes, 
the popular consensus being that it was okay as we had more stuff.
</p>

  <figcaption>Wakimika Lake</figcaption>
  <br>

<p>
After paddling south through Pencil Lake we pushed through a small creek and found ourselves on the beachy 
northern shore of Lake Wakimika. We struck out onto the water and soon took lunch on an island near the 
eastern shore. I had to grab a leech off my toe, adding to the various other foot injuries. A lunch of chorizo, 
cheddar, and tomato on wraps would keep us fueled to dinner, and more importantly, the Wakimika river.
<br><br>
The river turned out to be a winding waterway in two parts, the first requiring a series of liftovers and precise 
paddling to navigate, slowing our pace significantly. The environs were very pretty, with tall trees on either 
side casting shade on the water and the reeds and the slow, clear stream pulling us south. After a small lake to 
break up the river it widened for the second half and let us take a much more relaxed approach. We also saw the 
most wildlife yet. A small and a large sandpiper, herons, owl, beaver, kingfisher, and a crane.
</p>

  <br>
  
<p>
Leaving the confines of the river we made our way south through Obabika Lake with an increasingly strong 
tailwind speeding us along to our campsite: an island with two great pitches and a flat stone shore giving 
an expansive view to the east.
<br><br>
It was getting dark as we started our dinner of pasta with pesto and we decided to take the telescope out 
as we ate to admire the stars. This proved impossible as clouds rolled in once again, and as we washed our 
dishes and headed to sleep we hoped that a clear night sky would present itself before the trip was over.

<p>
After the clammy cold of the previous morning the weather today was uplifting. We awoke to a clear 
sunny sky and got to making our oats, intent on breaking camp earlier than the day before. 
</p>

  <br>

  <br>

<p>
We paddled south on Obabika Lake, bypassing the 900m portage in favour of a 400m and 100m. 
The longer portage turned out to be a winding forest path, the kind of trail you hope for going out on a hike.
</p>

  <br>

<p>
After crossing a small unnamed lake (I’m going to call it Golden Cove) we found ourselves in a 
lillypad-filled Obabika Inlet, and back on Lake Temagami. 
<br><br>
Golden Cove and Obabika Inlet proved to be one of the more scenic paddles we’d done with the 
high forested hills on all sides speckled with bands of yellow-turning birch trees
</p>

  <figcaption>The yellow bands of Golden Cove</figcaption>
  <br>

<p>
Intent on keeping the day short, we wanted to stop before the next 500m Portage and got off the 
water around 14:15 to make camp on an exposed peninsula with a panoramic view of the lake and the cliffs opposite.
<br><br>
Standing on the best jumping rock over a very deep part of the shore also proved to be the first 
time we spotted any fish larger than a minnow, but all we could really make out were their shadows 
contorting in the depths.
<br><br>
A late lunch of pasta aglio e olio followed the swims and we were happy to simply enjoy the sunshine 
after so many overcast hours.
<br><br>
Fishing led to a few intensive nibbles and a couple of grabs but nothing taken ashore.
<br>
As the sun went down we sat out looking across the bay, drinking bourbon out of a bottle of perrier 
and enjoying each other’s company as the sun went down.

<p>
Night fell and playing poker with skittles for chips lasted only a few hands (resulting in a 
crushing defeat for me and a mouthful of sweaty skittles for everyone else) before we were out 
stargazing, in awe at the darkness of the sky.

We woke again to a sunny morning and to a bald eagle circling the camp. Graeme tried his luck at fishing once 
again but the required party seemed uninterested. After again preparing oats and fruit for breakfast we broke 
camp and paddled past a semi-permanent cabin with some docks out front before reaching the portage to Devil Bay, 
a muddy 500m forest trail which Hudson decided to trapse through barefoot carrying a canoe. 
<br>
The blustery paddle out of Devil Bay to Ferguson Bay across the North Arm of Lake Temagami was long and fraught 
with waves. The constant up and down was too much for one of the seat struts which decided to take the rest of 
the trip off.
<br>
Luck would once again be on our side however, as we had a great tailwind and covered the remaining distance 
relatively quickly. Experiments in raising our towels as sails proved to be less effective than just paddling 
lazily and we checked out two sites, the easterly one where Stefan only slightly fell in the water, and a westerly 
one. We chose the latter, a raised campsite across from Sandy Inlet with great views of the Inlet, Pickerel Bay, and 
Mount Napoleon.
<br><br>
We reached the campsite and set up the tents. 
<br>
Breaking out the goggles we dove into the clear waters and saw some fish among the rocks, they were curious and 
swam up to us, but didn’t come nearer than half a metre. The drop off to the west also proved interesting as the 
sunny surface rocks gave way to dark impregnable waters below.

<p>
Dinner was ramen with onions, garlic, and the included sauce, which proved so spicy that Graeme had to 
get out a towel. He and Hudson ended up having to make some rice sides instead. After dinner, with the 
tents set up we watched the sun light the sky pink and then play that colour all across the waters of Ferguson Bay. 
Shortly after sundown some coyotes made themselves known as their howls carried across the water.

Euchre in the tent (triumphant victory by Stefan and Jonah) followed sitting by the fire and we retired to sleep, 
wary of the long journey back that lay ahead of us, but happy to be on the lake, in camp, and together for one 
last night.

We woke to the rain dowsing the tents, being still too early to do anything about it we rolled over and 
went back to sleep. When dawn truly came the rain had lessened somewhat and Ferguson Bay was beset by a heavy, 
driving fog that drifted through the trees like thick smoke.
<br>
We took down the tents in the rain and, anxious to get going, forewent breakfast.

<p>
A short paddle to the takeout and a long portage to the car brought us to the moment of truth. Had the spare 
tire survived the week inflated?
<br>
To our collective relief it had and after packing the car full of gear, tying the canoes on top, we set off on 
one of the most nerve-wracking drives of our lives. Behind every bump, every stone, and every puddle lay a flat 
tire in waiting, and a much more arduous journey home.
<br>
The road, being damp from the rain, was dustless, but if anything this only encouraged the logging truckers to 
drive more recklessly.
<br><br>
Having survived and dropped off our rentals at Smoothwater we drove to Temagami to get the rather squished-looking 
spare pumped up. A very nice man at the Temagami Auto Clinic let us use his compressor so we could pump it up from 
160 to 420kPa (23 to 60psi), where it should have been the whole time. The drive that followed can only be described 
as long. Rolling along at 80kph while absolutely everyone else overtakes you makes everything seem slower.
<br><br>
At last we made Toronto and after emptying the car we went our separate ways, home to a proper shower and a proper bed.
