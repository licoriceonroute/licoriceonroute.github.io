</h5>
<p>
	Two years ago, around Christmas, Wendy mentioned that she thought we should go on a bike trip together. 
	This past Christmas, we decided to start planning in earnest about where.
	The when was easy: the week in May with both of our birthdays.
<br><br>
	Eventually we selected Galicia in Spain, and planned a route which would combine sections of the 
	Camino de Santiago with some coastal routes and inland paths through small villages and towns.

    <br>
  <p>
	The goal from the start wasn’t to do big days in the saddle, 
	but to explore and enjoy the varying landscapes that would unfold around us.
<br><br>
	We'll camp at campsites every night and mostly eat at restaurants. A departure from previous tours.
<br><br>
	This would be the first tour where I would have to disassemble my bike in order to fly and even take 
	the high-speed trains with it. I was excited for that as well, but knew it would pose a few challenges along the way. 
	Not least of which was lugging the box everywhere.
<br><br>
	This trip would also bring new challenges, like not speaking Galician and a very limited knowledge of Spanish.

<p>
  My day started early, dragging my bike to catch the bus just after 4 and getting to the airport around 4:50. 
  Happily everything arrived in Madrid, and I met Wendy in Terminal 4, from where we made our way to Chamartín station. 
  Everything in Chamartín was under construction, and even after lugging everything around the closures we still had 
  around three hours before our train to Santiago de Compostela.
  <br><br>
  After deeming all the permanent seating in the station to be inadequate, we set up our camping chairs next to an out 
  of the way window and had a relaxing wait with Wendy offering up some Jam up the Mash and a third of the birthday 
  cake allowance we had for the week.

<p>
 The AVE train to Santiago, despite pre-booking a bike slot, didn’t seem to have much space for it. 
 However, it was packed in and we sped towards the North-west — at times hitting 299km/h. 
<br><br>
The scenery outside was one of treeless windswept hills and disjointed mountains. 
Everything was still green, the last time I was in Spain, in September/October it had been fairly dry and brown. 
I thought briefly about all the things we wouldn’t see in the North of Spain, and decided that if I liked 
Galicia enough, I would return to see more of the regions beyond.
<br><br>
After arriving at Santiago de Compostela, and dragging our things up the hill to the hotel, I put my bike back 
together and we set out to get Wendy’s rental.
<br><br>
The bikes available to rent at Cycling the Camino were all basically brand new and Wendy was quickly fitted 
with a bike and some bags.
<br><br>
Afterwards we dropped the bikes off in the hotel and went to find dinner—which ended up being paella with 
Estrella Galicia; the beer that would accompany us for the whole trip. 
<br><br>
A final, late, pack back at the hotel, and we were prepared for the day to come.

<p>
We arrived at the train station with time to spare, and loaded our bikes into ⅔ of the available spots in the carriage. 
A short 37minutes later we arrived in a drizzly Pontevedra.

  <figcaption>Start in Pontevedra</figcaption>
  <br>
  <br>
<p>
Pontevedra has been revitalized in the last decade with many of the streets in the city Center becoming pedestrianized. 
It was nice to bike through, and here we saw the first of the pilgrims on their way north. 
<br><br>
We stopped for an empanada break by the tidal river as the drizzle started to lessen before booking 
through a series of park paths and joining up with the Camino Portugués. 
<br><br>
Once on the Camino the overtaking began, the going was slow as not to startle or rush the pilgrims, 
and in the snippets of conversation I heard many Germans, South Africans, Australians, Americans and some 
Canadians; as well as Spanish and Portuguese.
<br><br>
Regardless, they fell behind as we pedaled northwards through villages, vineyards, and forests, 
biking on wide paved roads and skinny dirt tracks. The weather on this section would change between cloudy and drizzle. 
There were less and less pilgrims the further North we went, it seemed the wave that left Pontevendra early that morning was behind us for good. 
<br><br>
Some detours we took were planned — visiting a waterfall or a river “beach”  for instance — some were not — 
skipping around a group of around fifteen inexperienced horse riders who were not at all in control of their mounts.

<p>
Eventually we reached the end of our route with the Camino and, after some tortilla and empanada, 
we could increase our speed somewhat on the pilgrim-less roads. The rest of the day brought very little in 
the way of traffic, I can’t remember being overtaken once.
</p>

  <figcaption>Perks of Seeing a Wallflower</figcaption>
<br>
<p>
One section that stood out was a boardwalk through a marsh, the streams were full running beneath us, 
and the smell of the waterlogged forest was incredible. just behind the marsh were the Torres del Oste, 
built long ago to protect trade on the river. 
</p>

<p>EuroVelo route 1, whose sections in Galicia are not yet officially released, had some marked parts which 
coincided with our route. Here, on one of those sections, we had a steep climb (up to 16%) through a beautiful 
forest of eucalyptus; the ground littered with their fallen leaves and the bark sloughed off of their trunks 
still draped over the branches of every tree nearby. While pretty, there is a darker side to the introduction 
of the tree from Australia in the 19th century, it grows quickly and is ready to sell in just half the time of 
pine; this means it is <a href="https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/cp_data_news/eucalyptus-fever-speculation-and-

<br>

<p>
Coming off the higher elevations back down to the coast we reached a marshy trail that led to a footpath along 
the water, with some sections little more than a retaining wall above the river. We carried the bikes and gear 
across the unrideable sections and scraped our way through the gorse bushes along the singletrail. After a while 
we reached the open road once more and conquered the last few kilometres to the campsite. 
</p>

<p>
It became clear on reaching the campsite that the first thing we should do was take a swim, 
so after checking in with a nice older gentleman we followed an excited girl who was loudly imploring her 
family to go to the beach. 

The water proved cold and refreshing, the young girl needed no encouragement to splash around, 
but some older women (Wendy) were more trepidacious. The warm showers at the campsite washed the salt 
and weariness away for a moment, and we set up the tent and then went out for dinner in Rianxo. 

Although many of the restaurants were bustling, none were selling food either until 21:00 or the 
kitchens were closed for the night. Despite the best efforts of a kind local woman to help us find a 
suitable establishment, we settled on a frankly unpleasant burger which was at least open, and went to bed.

<p>
The night brought with it constant rain, some wind also showed itself, but we slept soundly. 
In the morning the snails were out in force, sliding across the tent and into our clothes which we 
kept in the vestibule.
</p>

  <figcaption>Wet, Slimy and Looking for a Pair of Shorts</figcaption>
<br>
  
<p>
We slept in late to avoid the rain, as soon as it let up we rode into Rianxo for some breakfast when it promptly 
began to rain again, this time much more violently. 
<br><br>
Their speciality appeared to be churros as there was always a fresh supply and three were served with every drink. 
I got a thick gooey hot chocolate, more like a hot chocolate pudding, perfect for dipping churros, Wendy 
had some red tea, which neither of us had heard of before. 
<br><br>
On the way out of Rianxo we saw an info board for the EuroVelo 1 in Galicia. The Xunta has started marking the 
route from the Portuguese border to Finsterra. It appears to be a new development as the link to download the 
gpx isn’t active and the turismo.gal doesn’t have the expected information. One huge positive is that the paseo 
maritimo of each town, which was previously exclusively for pedestrians, now allow bikes as well, giving us great 
routes along the waterfront.
</p>

<p>
We enjoyed lots of singletrail, some of it dangerously close to bushwhacking, and small streets through small towns. 
Wendy came out of a donnybrook with a blackberry vine looking like she’d smeared jam on her arm.

We stopped for an early lunch at the club nautico, and were thwarted again by the late Spanish opening times. 
We settled for a beer and some birthday cake to commemorate Wendy’s birthday.

Eventually we got to the campsite, a very pretty location overlooking the bay, and after a much needed shower we walked 
along the beach to a very hearty dinner.

<p>
Only starting around 11:00 we began by following some excellent seaside bicycle infrastructure. 
This turned into another very pleasant boardwalk bike and spectacular views of massive boulders, 
many clad in gorgeous orange lichen. These were paired with sparse laboratories and small factories. 
If I worked there—isolated on a picturesque, rugged coast—I would live in fear of a James Bond type 
arriving in a one man submarine and blowing me up. We continued on some hiking trails that proved to 
be too rugged for our bikes, so we rejoined the roads and tried again and again to get closer to the 
water with similar results.

<p>
One such attempt was crowned by a huge dune called the ‘wandering’ dune, and a dog of similar size looking 
over a wall at the bikers. From the dune we hightailed it to lunch, this was almost extraordinary. 
Not only was it open, serving food; it was also very tasty and the lunch menu was shockingly inexpensive to boot. 
<br><br>
Afterwards we went out to the point and our first lighthouse up close, the waves crashing on the dark rocks 
looked an icy blue, almost like mouthwash.

<p>
From the point we tried again to go along the coast, but it proved too Sandy for our tires and we took a 
service road just past the beach instead. This led us through a forest and down to a very steep medieval bridge, 
a beautiful structure of large stones, themselves smooth, but the bridge chunky. 
</p>

<p>
A short carry over the arch, and a short break for a snack, and we continued to the next tribulation: 
Wendy’s front tire had a flat. It was a slow leak, and so we decided to try and out-pump it. 
Because of that though we took the faster coastal highway route and not the trail climb that would have 
added 200m of elevation to the day. 
<br><br>
The coastal route was very pretty when you weren’t being passed by cars, and the sun played off the water, 
silver waves in the Atlantic.

<br>

<p>
The last 600m-long climb was gradually conquered and we arrived at the campsite, happy to have a shower to 
look forward to. 
<br><br>
First order of business however, was fixing the flat. A blackberry thorn had punctured the tire and poked a 
small hole in the tube. Luckily the tire was easy to remove and seat and that seemed to be the only intrusion.
<br><br><br><br>
Dinner was nice up on the patio looking over the water as the sunset turned to dusk, and we retired to our tent, 
earlier than yesterday, and ready for tomorrow.

<p>
The day started off sunny, unlike the days before and I could check my flat sleeping pad for leaks 
and dry it off before we set out. It seemed to be that the valve just got dirty, so hopefully cleaning 
it will help for tonight. 
<br><br>
We began with a punishing climb up the Miradoiro de San Lois, the view at the top was unspoilt by the 
generator running the telecommunications equipment, and we enjoyed it for a while. The bay stretched before us, 
little boats creating sparkling wakes as they crossed from one port to another. In the distance we could see the 
Atlantic, a deep blue before fading into the sky.

The descent was part paved and part mountain bike trail, loose stones skipping out from under our tires.

<p>
We descended into the town of Noia, the old town a tightly woven network of alleys and small streets 
hugged by buildings. Here we found a table in a square across from the church, where we enjoyed a much-needed lunch. 
<br><br>
After stopping at a supermarket for some provisions, we made our way up the coast  
<br><br>
We could see some rain clouds on the horizon and decided to keep going, when it hit it was a veritable 
downpour, soaking us through and through. Wendy decided to continue with a rain jacket and I stayed wet 
and warm with my windbreaker.

<p>
The rain hadn’t let up by the time we reached the Ponte Nafonso, a pretty bridge which we didn’t stop to enjoy. 
The rain let up a little on the next ascent, and the air warmed up considerably as well. 
<br><br>
We followed our route, interweaving with the EV1 and spending part of the afternoon in small streets through the 
villages and towns. 
<br><br>
When I tried to contact the campsite for tonight I hadn’t received any response. Feeling uneasy I tried to call 
all of the numbers but wasn’t able to get through on any of them. I called up the campground in San Francisco 
and they were happy to have us there instead. This would cut our day short, but that gave us more leeway when 
it came to the next section of our ride. 
<br><br>
To avoid the highway we took to the hills, biking along hiking paths that sometimes turned into small streams 
or just bushes. Along the paths there were old stone walls, completely covered with moss and overgrown with 
leafy plants. We explored a little, taking a turn up the hill and ended up in an apiary where I suppose we 
surprised the beekeeper who certainly wasn’t expecting to see two cyclists. 
</p>

<p>
The route up the hill ended in the forest, so we followed the walls back down to the road before taking another 
hiking path along the water and almost all the way into Muros. By this time everything save the shoes had dried 
in the warm air, and we were feeling better for it.
<br><br>
Muros was seen only briefly, as the only way through the centre was on the highroad. In those few moments though, 
we saw a very pretty town, with an impressive town hall and square on the water. A short climb through the West of 
Muros confirmed this impression, with wide stone staircases and older stone buildings like the church completing 
the well-kept image.

<br>

<p>
The last climb of the day led to a smooth asphalt descent, and we enjoyed the comparatively silky road up to 
the turn off for the campsite. 
<br><br>
We were a little late, so decided to set up everything to dry and then immediately have dinner—afterwards a 
much-needed shower was in order.

<p>
The first thing I noticed while biking through the upper reaches of Louro was the multitude of small granaries. 
There had been many up until now, but today would showcase the highest concentration by far along this stretch 
of Galician coast.
</p>

<br>
    <a href="https://licoriceonroute.github.io/file/image/Galicia_2025/Day_5/FaroMonteLouro.JPG">

  <figcaption>Faro Monte Louro</figcaption>
<br>

<p>
We rode out to the Faro de Monte Louro, taking the small road along the coast there and back. 
The lighthouse was set on the end of a peninsula with a small mountain, on the Atlantic side there 
stretched a large beach with a big lagoon.
</p>

<br>




<p>
We rode up above the highway, and in doing so got a great view of the beach and lagoon behind us, 
as well as the beach and lighthouse ahead. The second lighthouse, which doubles as a hotel, was fairly 
well-visited. We hadn’t seen many other tourists until now apart from some at the campsites, 
so even ten other people counts as well-visited here. 
<br><br>
We took the coastal walking path, requiring some carrying, and there we met a French couple mountain 
biking with whom we had a nice chat. The scenic trail brought us to the base of our first big planned climb, 
before which we bought some sandwich bread and toppings for lunch. 
</p>

<p>
We broke off the plan for the day after seeing the good weather and beautiful Praia de Carnota, 
and decided to shorten our route and take a break and a swim instead. The large rocks on the beach 
were a perfect place to take out our chairs. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
The water was cold, but not uncomfortably so, I would guess around 13-14°C, and after a short dip the shower 
at the beach parking lot washed all the salt away. Feeling refreshed we took the route we had planned with less 
elevation. We still had to pass over a mountain pass, But we would do it in one climb instead of dipping down for 
several.

<p>
The climb was all gravel, but fairly firm without the kickers that were rough on the San Lois climb. 
From the top we had an amazing view back across the coast we had just left, the beach stretching along the water, 
a thick white border to the azure Atlantic. Another swim now would have been nice after the sunny ascent.

<p>
We descended into the interior of Galicia, rolling hills stretched around us. A reservoir sparkled in the sun, 
we would pass the rushing rivers feeding it later. First though we biked over the dam and across the valley and 
the bay we could see Fisterra, known as the end of the world from Roman times until the new world was discovered.

<p>
The hilly terrain continued, and we pressed on, making it to the Hostel on the Camino (and, as a consequence, EuroVelo 3) 
in good time for a massive dinner; the soup starter alone was served in a terrine with three bowls worth inside.

<p>
We began early so we would have enough time when we got back to deal with everything and decompress.
<br><br>
Today we shared a lot of our route with the Camino Fisterra, where, unlike all other Caminos, 
the route leads away from Santiago de Compostela to the end of the earth. The advantages of this were that 
the pilgrims could see us coming and make space without us having to say anything or ring our bell making 
things much less stressful for everyone. 
<br><br>
The roads at the start were wide and there was little traffic. Sometimes we would break off to go down 
field paths or forest trails, dancing around the EV3 route. Biking along the EV3 gave me a similar feeling 
to last September when I walked part of the Trans-Canada trail in the Yukon and BC. Like I’ve hiked the Trans 
Canada trail in Ontario, I’ve biked the EV3 near Hamburg. Familiar yet far away, something that connects me to home. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
The trails of the Camino Fisterra were sometimes chunky and loose, but luckily those were mostly on the descents. 
We crossed waves of pilgrims coming the other way, sometimes there would be gaggles of them following each other, 
other times we would go two or three kms without seeing any.

We broke off the Camino to chase down a field into a few steep technical descents before arriving at a wonderful 
cycleway by a shady stream. The path was almost empty, only a few elderly patrons sat on the benches among the 
sound of rushing water. I was puzzled that such a nice path wasn’t part of the Camino, which here at Negreira 
follows the hot asphalt road.

Arriving through the imposing gates of Negreira we quickly passed through the town and after a few more 
rolling hills, as well as a shortcut through a hotel parking garage, we reached the outskirts of Santiago.

The last stretch into Santiago de Compostela was mostly shared with city traffic. 
A somewhat unpleasant ending only compounded by the crush of people in the pedestrian zone ahead of 
the cathedral square. 
<br><br>
The cathedral was very pretty, but we decided not to enter, not wanting to leave our bikes outside, 
unlike a group of Slovenians that left theirs standing in the square.

We returned to the hotel, this time avoiding the tourist zone; Wendy brought her bike back and 
I disassembled mine. Exhausted, we toasted the successful end of the trip with our remaining 
Jam Up the Mash and some Galician chips, before heading to dinner.

<p>
This was my first week long bike tour with another person and I certainly enjoyed having company for sharing 
the exploration of a new place. 
It was really amazing to have lots of time together, especially exploring and having fun in this beautiful landscape.
<br><br>
There are obviously a lot more considerations to take when you’re not alone, like eating scedules and
physical thresholds is, which is obviously more stressful than when it’s just 
your own fault you’re hungry, but I think we planned well and did really well to balance all of that.
<br><br>
Overall I got most of what I came for. The landscapes were pretty, the people were lovely, and other tourists were sparse 
apart from the pilgrims on the Camino which was a relief. I imagine the summers are more intensely visited.
The experience of travelling with my bike also helped immensely with my confidence going forward.
The weather was also pretty much ideal, one week earlier and we would have been rained out, and a week later it started getting hot.
<br><br>
The drivers were very respectful of cyclists. The only close passes we had were from oncoming traffic on small 
streets where they probably felt in control of the situation. Otherwise, even on the highways, there was always 
a good deal of distance and patience from other road users.
<br><br>
We didn’t see as many lighthouses as I had initially hoped while planning, but the beaches were great and even 
though a little cold, the water was amazing. I’m also very impressed by the seaside showers available at most beaches. 
I have a feeling I’ll be back in Galicia to see the less populated northern coast and see what there is to see there. 
I hope I’ll be able to dive into the culture and history a little more, as I didn’t feel I learned enough about this 
part of the Galician coast. 
<br><br>
The bike was a little annoying to drag everywhere, maybe the next time I fly I’ll assemble the bike at the airport 
and not take a train. I’ll feel more confident doing that now.
<br><br>
I found myself interacting less with local people on this trip, a factor of the language barrier, but also a 
factor of travelling with others. I also disliked camping at campgrounds every night, it was nice to have a shower 
and luckily the campgrounds were relatively empty, but still I don’t enjoy them very much.
<br><br>
Going to restaurants for every meal was also a novel concept for me, and one I don’t think I’ll continue. 
Being at the whim of whatever establishments are nearby and their opening times, combined with not knowing 
what you’re going to end up eating takes up more time and mental energy than just preparing it yourself. 
The only thing it saved was packed weight. I enjoyed getting to know the region through its cuisine as well, 
especially some dishes and meals were truly excellent. But some of the meals and evenings would have been 
easier had they been prepared by us.
<br><br>
Eating out also contributed to the very little downtime at the campsite and around the tent. There wasn’t 
enough free time to read or write, which for me is an important part of any trip. I’ll have to think about 
how to remedy that in the future.
<br><br>
All-in-all Galicia was a great place to explore and to enjoy in this time of year. I hope I’ll be able to 
go back someday to see more of it and to learn more about this special part of Europe.
<br><br>
Notes:
<br><br>
·Use a bike bag on Spanish Alta Velocidad trains. 
<br>
·The chairs were ultimately unnecessary as we had seating at most campsites. The sit pads remain an imperative. 
<br>
·Rough eating for vegetarians
<br>
·The supermarkets aren’t well stocked with a lot of the produce especially being unripe and not ready to eat.
<br>
·Water remains easily available through fountains in almost every town. I probably would have been ok with one 
or two bottles. 
<br>
·If cycling the Camino, always bike contra-flow as overtaking the pilgrims is awful.
